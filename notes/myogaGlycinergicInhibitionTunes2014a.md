## Key takeaways

### 1. “Inhibition modulates the peak timing of excitation” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=JJZJIRAM)):
1. “we first extracted the time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (EPSGs and IPSGs, respectively) in a separate set of voltage-clamp experiments. Individual conductance waveforms were then selected and injected as templates into the soma using conductance-clamp to simulate excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs, respectively), which produced events that largely resembled synaptically evoked responses. This allowed us to investigate precise temporal interactions” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=3R9H2V67))
2. “Inhibitory inputs are predominantly restricted to the soma, and thus simulating IPSPs with conductance-clamp is suitable to mimic realistic IPSPs.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=8K4ANVI2))
3. “we found timing conditions that advanced the peak timing of both the synaptically evoked and conductance-clamp-simulated EPSPs ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.1 ms$, F-stim: 62±8 ms; G-clamp: 53±3 ms, n = 7; Fig. 1f,g, left) and others that delayed the peak of the EPSPs, albeit to a lesser extent ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.6 ms$, F-stim: 21±9 ms; G-clamp: 4±6 ms, n = 7; Fig. 1f,g, right).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=SZKJDGBC))

### 2. “Input speed and balance influence peak shift magnitude.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=SVDHSQJJ)):
1. “Peak shifts were substantially dependent on excitatory input kinetics, where slower excitation ($\tau_{exc} = 0.5 ms$) was comparably more sensitive to peak shifts in both directions” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=3&annotation=NK9QK9LQ))
2. “faster inhibition ($\tau_{IPSG} = 1.0 ms$) was more effective at enforcing the peak delay” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=3&annotation=AQ453HRS))

### 4. “Inhibition tunes coincidence detection” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=9L32YXES)):
- Because excitation from both sides have equal strength and summate linearly at the soma, we injected two identical EPSGs at various relative times ($\Delta t_{exc}$) to simulate ITDs in vitro [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=J744D5BY)
- We then determined whether a single IPSP (timed relative to the contralateral EPSP) could bias the excitatory timing of best PSP summation (PSP sum) or greatest action potential probability (AP prob). [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=RWLHNEDF)
- For these experiments, it matters at what $\Delta t_{exc}$ the largest summation or the most action potentials occur and not when they occur, which was the case for previous experiments [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=GL5N6AVQ)
- In the absence of inhibition, these functions peaked near zero [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=XJ8IAQW7)
- Inhibitory timing conditions that advanced the peak of the contralateral EPSP ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.1ms$) biased subthreshold summation and action potential probability functions towards ipsilateral-leading excitation [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=VK47ZYDJ)
- timing conditions that delayed the peak of the contralateral EPSP ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.6 ms$) biased coincidence detection towards contralateral-leading excitation, albeit to a lower extent [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=8SRLL49Y)
- Thus, a precisely timed contralateral IPSP can modulate coincidence detection in a bidirectional manner, but only under timing conditions that had not been previously explored [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=7VR7QIHP)
- £ many cases where the EPSP was much slower than our average in vitro measurements [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=V54SPBN8): **the rise time or the total time it took to reach MSO?** ^b67e3e
- we also evaluated the slow-speed EPSG paired with the average-speed IPSG (Fig. 4b–i,k, chartreuse). The peaks of both PSP summation and action potential probability functions were biased comparably further towards ipsilateral leading ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.2 ms$, PSP sum: 136±2 ms, n = 5; AP prob: 127±3 ms, n = 7) and contralateral-leading ($\Delta t_{inh} = 0.4ms$, PSP sum: 64±5 ms, n = 5; AP prob: 66±3 ms, n = 12) excitation [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=42MAHUXY)

### 5. “Synaptic jitter enhances peak shifts” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=PEBW9UCU)):
- We introduced jitter with gamma distribution functions of up to 640 ms in halfwidth [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=NQWZWGP9)

- Increasing excitatory jitter alone robustly increased peak shifts in both directions [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=92HAEFVU)
- and increasing inhibitory jitter alone decreased peak shifts [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=ECSLLVP6)
- Interestingly, increasing both excitatory and inhibitory jitter resulted in a net increase in peak shifts [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=TLPLGDFA)
- Evaluation of individual trials revealed that substantially jittered conditions increase the diversity of peak shift magnitudes. However, the distribution of all trials shows a trend towards larger peak shifts with equal amounts of excitatory and inhibitory jitter. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=VJTC867E)
- $ These findings indicate that naturally occurring synaptic jitter enhances inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts, despite the degradation of peak timing precision that was recently suggested to diminish its efficacy. As ITD tuning at low frequencies has been particularly difficult to explain by axon length disparity, these findings support an especially important role of inhibition for ITD tuning in the low-frequency range [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=DPL7EYMA)
### 6. “Precise inhibition maintains efficacy at high frequencies” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=NALFSISJ)):
> [!cite]+ Image [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=WK8JVLQT)
> ![[media/zotero/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a-8-x46-y496.png]]
- & At high frequencies, synaptic jitter is much less, but IPSPs naturally summate [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=I8485JJ2)
- & We thus challenged inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts with 16 pulse trains at 333, 500 and 800 Hz under timing conditions that produced a large peak advance (Dtinh = 0.1 ms) and delay (Dtinh = 0.6 ms) [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=UVFAGPZX)
- & Despite substantial summation (Fig. 6a, red, and Supplementary Fig. 7), inhibition sustained the ability to advance (Fig. 6b, left) and delay (Fig. 6b, right) EPSP peak timing, even at 800 Hz [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=JY6NTE76)
- $ strengthening the translation from inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts to coincidence detection timing. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=KA8T6IHE)
### 7.  “Bilateral inhibition extends the range of tuning.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=SGHTIAYP))
- £ **why subthreshold?**:
	- To this point, we have considered only the influence of one (contralateral) inhibitory pathway on synaptic integration and coincidence detection. However, in the full MSO circuit both ipsilateral and contralateral inhibition are present. We therefore examined the additional effect of a second, precisely timed (putative ipsilateral) inhibition in biasing subthreshold PSP summation (Fig. 7a). [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=STSK2H6D)
- In these experiments, we timed the ipsilateral IPSP relative to its corresponding EPSP ($\Delta t_{inhi}$) and used the slow speed EPSG paired with the average-speed IPSG to evaluate the extent of inhibitory modulation on synaptic integration under our experimental conditions (Fig. 7b). [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=4IXI7ILM)
- ipsilateral IPSP will also interact with the contralateral EPSP, but because it is locked in time to the ipsilateral EPSP, the integration of all four synaptic inputs can be conceptually simplified as two composite PSPs from each side that summate linearly. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=XWYKSAX9)
- In each case, the additional ipsilateral IPSP biased the timing of best PSP summation in a manner nearly equal and opposite to that of the contralateral IPSP at each $\Delta t_{inhc}$ tested. This is consistent with an ipsilateral IPSP that shifts the peak timing of the ipsilateral EPSP in the same manner as for the contralateral side, which would in fact produce the inverse influence on coincidence detection timing [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=RK9F5EBD)
 > [!cite]+ Image [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=9&annotation=ZIG9M4XW)
> ![[media/zotero/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a-9-x32-y116.png]]
- Now considering the temporal integration of all four synaptic inputs, inhibition can bias coincidence detection up to 220±10 ms towards ipsilateral-leading excitation ($\Delta t_{inhc}$ = 0.2 and $\Delta t_{inhi}$ = -0.4 ms; Fig. 7e) and up to 217±19 ms towards contralateral leading excitation ($\Delta t_{inhc}$ = -0.4 and $\Delta t_{inhi}$ = 0.2 ms; Fig. 7k) [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=JH7XT5N2)
- Remarkably, this >400 ms dynamic range is achieved within a timing window of just 0.6 ms (Fig. 8a). This is important, because even though we do not know what other internal delays may be generated in the circuit, inhibition can provide additional timing shifts that largely span the distribution of gerbil ITD functions recorded in vivo (Fig. 8b)6–8,43, which has been thus far unsuccessful by axon length disparity-based models of ITD tuning. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=JKFHK4TL)
- £ Interestingly, at timing conditions where inhibition is most capable of influencing coincidence detection, IPSPs would largely be masked by EPSPs, which is compatible with the in vivo observation that even at low frequencies IPSPs remained undetected between cycles [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=MZ4NXD7N) ^0646b1

### conclusion
- We found that inhibition was indeed capable of modulating the timing of excitation, but that a leading contralateral inhibition alone only modestly biased coincidence detection timing towards the contralateral-leading side (B50 ms; Fig. 4h,i). However, adding the ipsilateral source of inhibition, which has received much less attention, could bias coincidence detection a further 150 ms towards the contralateral-leading side (Fig. 7k). These data strongly support the in vivo pharmacological experiments [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=QJ6J4YUX)
- £ cochlear delays [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=JKYWKMDP) ^e7c04f
- we deliberately made no assumptions about the actual arrival times of excitation and inhibition and indeed found other timing conditions that generated pronounced modulation of coincidence detection timing. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=PTAR5PGJ)
- Our present results indicate that the **ipsilateral source of inhibition** may be in fact crucial to ITD tuning, and thus future studies are required to elucidate the role of its substantial input to the MSO. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=2X5QPTX7)
- A second recent study investigated ITD tuning in vivo using whole-cell recordings. A pronounced leading inhibition could not be detected, contradicting the in vitro measurements. It was nevertheless reasoned from the lack of detection that the temporal precision of inhibition was not sufficient to tune ITD functions. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that inhibitory modulation of excitatory timing is in fact resilient to synaptic jitter (Fig. 5) and summation (Fig. 6). More importantly, under timing conditions where inhibition is most effective at influencing coincidence detection timing (Fig. 8a), IPSPs would be masked by EPSPs on each cycle. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=CXUXKFGV)
- Unfortunately, as currently available in vivo electrophysiological techniques are insufficient to resolve excitatory and inhibitory events independently, the exact arrival time of excitation and inhibition to MSO neurons remains unknown. The manner in which inhibition tunes ITD functions in vivo thus remains an open question. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=VYARH3TX)

> Neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) detect microsecond differences in the arrival time of sounds between the ears (interaural time differences or ITDs), a crucial binaural cue for sound localization. Synaptic inhibition has been implicated in tuning ITD sensitivity, but the cellular mechanisms underlying its influence on coincidence detection are debated. Here we determine the impact of inhibition on coincidence detection in adult Mongolian gerbil MSO brain slices by testing precise temporal integration of measured synaptic responses using conductance-clamp. We find that inhibition dynamically shifts the peak timing of excitation, depending on its relative arrival time, which in turn modulates the timing of best coincidence detection. Inhibitory control of coincidence detection timing is consistent with the diversity of ITD functions observed in vivo and is robust under physiologically relevant conditions. Our results provide strong evidence that temporal interactions between excitation and inhibition on microsecond timescales are critical for binaural processing.

- & MSO neurons generally respond best to contralateral-leading ITDs. To allow best coincidence detection of such temporally staggered inputs, the circuit must generate internal delays to compensate for the external delay created by the head. A longer excitatory path length from the contralateral side can explain this phenomenon at the population level, but there is increasing evidence that axonal length disparity9 alone is insufficient to explain the diversity of preferred ITDs observed in vivo10–13. Thus, it has become a crucial question how individual neurons within the population are tuned to their specific ITDs, an answer to which is necessary for a complete understanding of low-frequency sound localization in mammals.

### results
#### inhibition modulates the peak timing of excitation
- & we first extracted the time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (EPSGs and IPSGs, respectively) in a separate set of voltage-clamp experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1). Individual conductance waveforms were then selected and injected as templates into the soma using conductance-clamp to simulate excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs, respectively), which produced events that largely resembled synaptically evoked responses (Supplementary Fig. 2). This allowed us to investigate precise temporal interactions [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=3R9H2V67)
- & the original inhibitory model of ITD tuning proposes that inhibition modulates the timing of best coincidence by enforcing a shift in the peak timing of excitation on each side [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=LCM8JH8T)
- & Inhibitory inputs are predominantly restricted to the soma35–37, and thus simulating IPSPs with conductance-clamp is suitable to mimic realistic IPSPs. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=2&annotation=8K4ANVI2)

- & Peak shifts were substantially dependent on excitatory input kinetics, where slower excitation (tEPSG = 0.5 ms) was comparably more sensitive to peak shifts in both directions [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=3&annotation=NK9QK9LQ)

- **model based though. good model, but model based**:
	- $ KLTA activity promotes inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts by speeding the decay kinetics of the IPSP, and therefore may have a more influential role in facilitating E–I interactions during development [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=55WVPG4M)
#### inhibition tunes coincidence detection.
- & Because excitation from both sides have equal strength (Supplementary Fig. 1) and summate linearly at the soma8,26, we injected two identical EPSGs at various relative times (Dtexc) to simulate ITDs in vitro (Fig. 4a, see Methods) [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=J744D5BY)
- & We then determined whether a single IPSP (timed relative to the contralateral EPSP) could bias the excitatory timing of best PSP summation (PSP sum) or greatest action potential probability (AP prob). [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=RWLHNEDF)
- & For these experiments, it matters at what Dtexc the largest summation or the most action potentials occur and not when they occur, which was the case for previous experiments [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=GL5N6AVQ)
- & In the absence of inhibition, these functions peaked near zero [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=5&annotation=XJ8IAQW7)
- & Inhibitory timing conditions that advanced the peak of the contralateral EPSP (Dtinh = 0.1 ms) biased subthreshold summation and action potential probability functions towards ipsilateral-leading excitation [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=VK47ZYDJ)
- & timing conditions that delayed the peak of the contralateral EPSP (Dtinh = 0.6 ms) biased coincidence detection towards contralateral-leading excitation, albeit to a lower extent [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=8SRLL49Y)
- & Thus, a precisely timed contralateral IPSP can modulate coincidence detection in a bidirectional manner, but only under timing conditions that had not been previously explored [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=7VR7QIHP)
- **the rise time or the total time it took to reach MSO?**:
	- £ many cases where the EPSP was much slower than our average in vitro measurements [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=V54SPBN8) ^eb843d
- & we also evaluated the slow-speed EPSG paired with the average-speed IPSG (Fig. 4b–i,k, chartreuse). The peaks of both PSP summation and action potential probability functions were biased comparably further towards ipsilateralleading (Dtinh = 0.2 ms, PSP sum: 136±2 ms, n = 5; AP prob: 127±3 ms, n = 7) and contralateral-leading (Dtinh = 0.4 ms, PSP sum: 64±5 ms, n = 5; AP prob: 66±3 ms, n = 12) excitation [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=42MAHUXY)
#### synaptic jitter enhances peak shifts
- & We introduced jitter to four EPSGs and IPSGs with gamma distribution functions of up to 640 ms in halfwidth [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=NQWZWGP9)
- & Increasing excitatory jitter alone robustly increased peak shifts in both directions [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=92HAEFVU)
- & and increasing inhibitory jitter alone decreased peak shifts [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=ECSLLVP6)
- & Interestingly, increasing both excitatory and inhibitory jitter resulted in a net increase in peak shifts [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=6&annotation=TLPLGDFA)

> **author's argument: because these two are similar, inhibition's "message" is accurately delivered in both fast and slow excitation. i think**

- & Evaluation of individual trials revealed that substantially jittered conditions increase the diversity of peak shift magnitudes (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the distribution of all trials (Supplementary Fig. 6) shows a trend towards larger peak shifts with equal amounts of excitatory and inhibitory jitter. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=VJTC867E)
- $ These findings indicate that naturally occurring synaptic jitter enhances inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts, despite the degradation of peak timing precision that was recently suggested to diminish its efficacy8,26. As ITD tuning at low frequencies has been particularly difficult to explain by axon length disparity11, these findings support an especially important role of inhibition for ITD tuning in the low-frequency range [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=DPL7EYMA)
#### Precise inhibition maintains efficacy at high frequencies
- **not that high, right? it's still 1/20th the highest freq... but then no itd**
- & At high frequencies, synaptic jitter is much less, but IPSPs naturally summate [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=I8485JJ2)
- & We thus challenged inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts with 16 pulse trains at 333, 500 and 800 Hz under timing conditions that produced a large peak advance (Dtinh = 0.1 ms) and delay (Dtinh = 0.6 ms) [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=UVFAGPZX)
- & Despite substantial summation (Fig. 6a, red, and Supplementary Fig. 7), inhibition sustained the ability to advance (Fig. 6b, left) and delay (Fig. 6b, right) EPSP peak timing, even at 800 Hz [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=JY6NTE76)
- $ strengthening the translation from inhibition-enforced EPSP peak shifts to coincidence detection timing. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=KA8T6IHE)
- **todo: what does this mean?
i think it means that while at lower frequencies the SHAPE of the PSP is influenced by inhibition, at higher frequencies the shape of the PSP is still "normal" IPSP still arrives AND the timing of peak is still affected**:
	- £ Importantly, at higher frequencies IPSPs cannot be discerned during the train regardless of whether they lead or lag EPSPs (Fig. 6a, bottom and Supplementary Fig. 8a, bottom). This is remarkably consistent with the inability to detect IPSPs from in vivo whole-cell recordings8. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=7NTAMU2H)
#### bilateral inhibition extends the range of tuning.
- **why subthreshold?**:
	- & To this point, we have considered only the influence of one (contralateral) inhibitory pathway on synaptic integration and coincidence detection. However, in the full MSO circuit both ipsilateral and contralateral inhibition are present31,41. We therefore examined the additional effect of a second, precisely timed (putative ipsilateral) inhibition in biasing subthreshold PSP summation (Fig. 7a). [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=STSK2H6D)
- & In these experiments, we timed the ipsilateral IPSP relative to its corresponding EPSP ($\Delta t_{inhi}$) and used the slowspeed EPSG paired with the average-speed IPSG to evaluate the extent of inhibitory modulation on synaptic integration under our experimental conditions (Fig. 7b). [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=4IXI7ILM)
- £ Importantly, an ipsilateral IPSP will also interact with the contralateral EPSP, but because it is locked in time to the ipsilateral EPSP, the integration of all four synaptic inputs can be conceptually simplified as two composite PSPs from each side that summate linearly at the soma. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=7&annotation=XWYKSAX9)

> ![[media/zotero/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a/myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014a-7-x45-y310.png]]

- & In each case, the additional ipsilateral IPSP biased the timing of best PSP summation in a manner nearly equal and opposite to that of the contralateral IPSP at each $\Delta t_{inhc}$ tested. This is consistent with an ipsilateral IPSP that shifts the peak timing of the ipsilateral EPSP in the same manner as for the contralateral side, which would in fact produce the inverse influence on coincidence detection timing [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=RK9F5EBD)
- $ Now considering the temporal integration of all four synaptic inputs, inhibition can bias coincidence detection up to 220±10 ms towards ipsilateral-leading excitation ($\Delta t_{inhc}$ = 0.2 and $\Delta t_{inhi}$ = 0.4 ms; Fig. 7e) and up to 217±19 ms towards contralateralleading excitation ($\Delta t_{inhc}$ = 0.4 and $\Delta t_{inhi}$ = 0.2 ms; Fig. 7k) [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=JH7XT5N2)
- & Remarkably, this 4400 ms dynamic range is achieved within a timing window of just 0.6 ms (Fig. 8a). This is important, because even though we do not know what other internal delays may be generated in the circuit, inhibition can provide additional timing shifts that largely span the distribution of gerbil ITD functions recorded in vivo (Fig. 8b)6–8,43, which has been thus far unsuccessful by axon length disparity-based models of ITD tuning11. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=JKFHK4TL)
- **huh?**:
	- £ Interestingly, at timing conditions where inhibition is most capable of influencing coincidence detection, IPSPs would largely be masked by EPSPs, which is compatible with the in vivo observation that even at low frequencies IPSPs remained undetected between cycles8 [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=MZ4NXD7N)
### discussion
- The original inhibition-based model was grounded on the finding that blocking glycinergic inhibition in vivo shifted contralateral-leading ITD functions towards zero. It was thought that a leading contralateral inhibition predominantly mediates this effect by delaying the effective peak timing of contralateral excitation. This mechanism was questioned because it required unusually fast and artificial IPSP kinetics and a level of temporal precision that would be diminished by synaptic jitter and summation [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=NTR9J5VZ)
- We found that inhibition was indeed capable of modulating the timing of excitation, but that a leading contralateral inhibition alone only modestly biased coincidence detection timing towards the contralateral-leading side (B50 ms; Fig. 4h,i). However, adding the ipsilateral source of inhibition, which has received much less attention, could bias coincidence detection a further 150 ms towards the contralateral-leading side (Fig. 7k). These data strongly support the in vivo pharmacological experiments [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=8&annotation=QJ6J4YUX)

- & Although inhibition is one of several mechanisms that may work in concert to tune neurons to their preferred ITDs, it can accomplish this simply by adjustments or adaptations of synaptic properties43,44, a more flexible solution compared with axonal length adjustments [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=2D3HICUR)

- & a single IPSP at the average timing condition (Dtinh = 0.3 ms) did not tune ITD functions. It was concluded that inhibition, while important for coincidence detection, is not relevant for ITD tuning [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/Q3P69ZLK?page=10&annotation=HPTMF9Y2)

- & A second recent study investigated ITD tuning in vivo using whole-cell recordings. A pronounced leading inhibition could not be detected8, contradicting the in vitro measurements. It was nevertheless reasoned from the lack of detection that the temporal precision of inhibition was not sufficient to tune ITD functions. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that inhibitory modulation of excitatory timing is in fact resilient to synaptic jitter (Fig. 5) and summation (Fig. 6). More importantly, under timing conditions where inhibition is most effective at influencing coincidence detection timing (Fig. 8a), IPSPs would be masked by EPSPs on each cycle.

- & Unfortunately, as currently available in vivo electrophysiological techniques are insufficient to resolve excitatory and inhibitory events independently8, the exact arrival time of excitation and inhibition to MSO neurons remains unknown.
