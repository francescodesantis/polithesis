## 1. pro "leading inhibition causes delayed EPSP"
1. **evidence**: MNTB-caused inhibition is very well phase-locked \cite{smithAnatomyPhysiologyPrincipal1998}
   **interpretation**: if every cycle delayed EPSP, it would work

2. **evidence**: strychnine shifts ODs of MSO neurons to tones toward 0ms. \cite{brandPreciseInhibitionEssential2002a}
   **interpretation**: excitatory inputs from both ears arrive in-phase, but the contralateral is delayed by the *leading* inhibition, causing a positive OD (turned off by strychnine)
   
3. **evidence**: leading inhibition is observed \cite{robertsMechanisticUnderstandingRole2013a}

## 2. neutral
1. **evidence**: summation of monaural subthreshold responses to ipsi and contralateral stimulation predicts binaural suprathreshold response \cite{vanderheijdenDirectionalHearingLinear2013}
   **interpretation**: it's just excitation

## 3. against
1. **evidence**: variance in recorded signal is lowest at unfavorable IPDs (lower than spontaneous)\cite{vanderheijdenDirectionalHearingLinear2013}
   **interpretation**: there is no phase-locked inhibition preceding EPSPs (missing the link but yin phrases it like this)

2. **evidence**: *in vivo* intracellular gerbil recording fails to provide evidence for sustained, phase-locked inhibition \cite{frankenVivoCoincidenceDetection2015}
   **intepretation**: no sustained, phase-locked inhibition

3. **evidence**: comparing before and after strychnine suggests effect on sustained ITDs \cite{peckaInterauralTimeDifference2008}

4. **evidence**: leading IPSPs observed for both ipsi and contra synaptic stimulation, but no "delaying effect of MNTB inputs" \cite{robertsMechanisticUnderstandingRole2013a}; "we found that preceding inhibition *advanced* the peaks of EPSPs by up to 50 Î¼s"

5. **evidence**: at high frequencies, IPSPs summate [source missing]
   **interpretation**: at high frequencies, IPSPs cannot maintain same function
   **counter-evidence**: inhibition maintains its ability to influence EPSP peak timing and synaptic integration at high frequencies, despite undergoing substantial summation that was recently suggested to diminish its efficacy \cite{myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014}

## MYOGA
1. **evidence**: leading inhibition has minimal effect on timing of peak of ensuing EPSP\cite{myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014}
   **interpretation**: lagging (rather than leading) IPSPs have an advancing (rather than delaying) effect on EPSPs triggered by ipsilateral ear
   **problem**: roberts only observed early inhibition for both ipsi and contra, so when is lagging inhibition?

Myoga's answer to "inhibition is often undetected" is "you're missing it": Interestingly, at timing conditions where inhibition is most capable of influencing coincidence detection, IPSPs would largely be masked by EPSPs, which is compatible with the in vivo observation that even at low frequencies IPSPs remained undetected between cycles8. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the strong afterhyperpolarizations following EPSPs recorded in vivo reflect the re-depolarization phase of a precisely timed IPSP that occurs nearly concomitant. \cite{myogaGlycinergicInhibitionTunes2014}
