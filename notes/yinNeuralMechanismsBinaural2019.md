> Spatial hearing, and more speciﬁcally the ability to localize sounds in space, is one of the most studied and best understood aspects of hearing. Because there is no coding of acoustic space at the receptor organ, physiological sensitivity to spatial aspects of sounds ﬁrst emerges in the central nervous system. Much progress has been made in the identiﬁcation and characterization of the circuits in the auditory brainstem that create sensitivity to binaural and monaural cues toward acoustic space. We review the progress over the past third of a century, with a focus on the mammalian brainstem and on the anatomy and cellular physiology underlying the physiological tuning of monaural and binaural circuits to acoustic cues toward spatial hearing. In addition to examining the detailed mechanisms involved in the processing of the three main spatial cues, we also review the integration of these cues and their use toward behavior. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

Similar tests with ITDs and spectral cues confirmed that, as predicted, ILDs are the most effective cue and ITDs are the least effective” ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))

>> Structure:
>> 
>> The fibers of the VIIIth cranial nerves are 90% afferent (ear->CNS), 10% efferent (CNS->ear).
>> 
>> 90-95% of afferent are type I fibers:  
>> - from spiral ganglion cells in cochlea of each inner ear to central nervous system(**where**?):  
>> - large cell bodies in spiral ganglion ensheathed by glial, very myelinated  
>> - each innervates a single IHC  
>> - glutamatergic synapses on dendrites of multiple cell types in CN (**which?**)
>> 
>> 5-10% of afferent are type II fibers:  
>> - smaller, unsheathed cell body  
>> - unmyelinated thin peripheral process (**?**) enters rows of outer hair cells and heads toward cochlear base to ~10 outer hair cells, tipically in the same row  
>> - axon is unmyelinated and go into CN; [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=undefined) “are thought to provide glutamatergic innervation to CN cells”
>> 
>> Because type I fibers are majority and thicker, [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=undefined) “virtually all references to auditory responses of ANFs are undoubtedly recordings from type I fibers. Type II fibers are much more difficult to record from, and although the anatomy of their projection is known, virtually no information is available about their response properties. A few early reports indicate that type II fibers are insensitive to sound” “may instead respond when there is sound-induced outer hair cell damage. Thus, this input may be transmitting nociceptive information centrally”
>> 
>> Efferent axons form LOC (mostly ipsilateral, in or around LSO) and MOC (bilateral, in VNTB). [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1506&annotation=BLPVLY7C) “The function of the efferents is beyond the scope of this article”
>> 
>> Type I ANFs innervate a single IHC, so vibration of a single point on **basilar membrane**; so are expected to inherit frequency tuning and tonotopic organization of basilar membrane with sensitivity to low frequencies for IHCs near apex and high frequencies near the base.
>> 
>> To study responses of ANFs to pure tones at CF, yo udeliver many (>100 reps) short-duration (25-100ms) tones and creating PSTHs by binning hte time of each spike relative to tone onset. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1506&annotation=4CYRBXTS) “Essentially, the PSTH shows the probability of a spike relative to stimulus onset”(**???**). There are two types of histograms:  
>> - CFs above 3-5 kHz: initial latent period, then high rate of discharge that adapts to a steady rate within 20 ms. In general, low spontaneous activity -> low initial rate; slow adaptation; high SR -> high initial rate, fast adaptation  
>> - CFs < 3-5kHz: respond to a preferred phase of the input tone (phase locking)
>> 
>> The different classes of ANFs [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1507&annotation=PKU4HFTT) “classified by spontaneous activity are not due to differences in IHC properties, that is there are no highand low-spontaneous IHCs”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1506&annotation=DLAAW75J) “Invariably, electrophysiological recordings from neurons rely on temporal averaging of many repetitions of a sound to infer the probability of response of a cell. Clearly the nervous system does not rely on many repetitions of the same stimulus to deduce the sound and its properties. The underlying assumption is that the temporal averaging used in single cell recording mimics the spatial averaging of many fibers with the same properties in the brain.”
>> 
>> CF of an ANF is directly related to the location along the basilar membrane.
>> 
>> ## Temporal processing
>> 
>> ### Phase Locking
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1507&annotation=PE7FV44H) “The functional polarization of the hair cell stereocilia causes the hair cell to be depolarized with movement of the hair bundle toward the tallest stereocilia and hyperpolarized when moved in the opposite direction”, and each pair of up and down is a cycle of a sine wave stimulus. the receptor potentials in vivo show a response with both an AC component (matching the stimulus frequency) and a DC component (matching the stimulus strength. However, at high frequency the AC part disappears (independently from CF).
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=NN7BYJSI) “Phase-locking is usually quantified by the vector strength metric (199), which varies between 0 (all histogram bins equal, or no preferred phase) and 1 (all spikes fall into one bin) and is labeled R in Figure 2B. In all mammals studied, the vector strength is high at low frequencies and drops off at high frequencies, usually becoming insignificant above 3 to 5 kHz.” “for two-tone complexes, the ANFs will phase-lock to one or both of the tones, depending on the relative magnitude of each component (245).”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=J6YJ7Q4X) “However, high-frequency ANFs can phase-lock to the envelope of complex stimuli, such as a sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tone (263, 280, 289, 434, 485, 610, 611, 718).”
>> 
>> ### Reverse correlation
>> 
>> How can you show that ANFs ecnode both spectral and temporal aspects of stimulus? You use REVCOR. You play white noise, and record the stimulus right before the spikes happen; then you average these recordings and you’ll get some general “rule” for when the ANF is spiking. The peak frequency of the revcor filter agrees with the CF of the ANF. **Not really strong IMO**.
>> 
>> ### Autocorrelogram
>> 
>> But then, how does the brain actually know this shit? They record previous stimuli and average them??? Nah. the autocorrelogram just counts spikes. First row is a single spike train (you can’t see much). Second row is many spike trains, and you start seeing a clear patter in how they spike -> the first column has a 550Hz CF, so it fires at 0, and some at 2ms …
>>

>> ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))
>> 
>> ## Coding of the stimulus level
>> 
>> The paper doesn’t really say much: the ANFs saturate at ~40dB, but we can hear until 120dB. BOH?
>> 
>> # Overview of the brainstem Auditory Pathways
>> 
>> …
>> 
>> Most pathway is monaural, but there are some binaural sensitivity clues.
>> 
>> ## Superior Olivary Complex
>> 
>> LSO and MSO and MNTB are in SOC. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1519&annotation=M5ENJ3TN) “MNTB cells are monaural and respond to stimulation of the contralateral ear, MSO cells respond to stimulation of both ears, and LSO cells are excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear and inhibited by stimulation of the contralateral ear”
>> 
>> ### Medial Superior Olive
>> 
>> In most animals, the MSO is a thin sheet of cells, oriented in an angled parasagittal plane between LSO and MNTB.
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=ZVIAVJWS) “The primary inhibitory inputs to MSO are from neurons in the MNTB and LNTB on the same side that synapse primarily on the principal cell body” ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=9UPCFA5P) “In gerbil, it is estimated that an MSO principal cell receives a minimum of 4 to 8 excitatory inputs and 2 to 4 inhibitory inputs” ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=YSGJQDSQ) “In ICC, their round vesicle-containing terminals synapse on cells predominantly in the low-frequency lamina (379, 474) overlapping with terminals from ipsilateral, but not contralateral, LSO”
>> 
>> In vivo recordings from MSO are rare due to small action potentials and large field potentials that make spike isolation hard
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=M2A2TGXF) “Remarkably, stimulation of the ipsilateral or contralateral AN in a thick slice that retains connections from AN to SOC (532, 533) elicits an IPSP that arrives at the MSO before the EPSP despite an additional synapse in the inhibitory pathway.”
>> 
>> ### Lateral Superior Olive
>> 
>> 4 known auditory inputs:
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=ZPJ85LJD) “(i) SBCs and (ii) T-stellate neurons of the ipsilateral VCN, (iii) principal neurons in the MNTB on the same side which are providing inhibitory input from the GBCs of the contralateral side, and (iv) small multipolar neurons in the contralateral VNTB”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=8HUD39EA) “The strongest inputs are thought to be involved in the sound localization process: excitatory glutamatergic inputs from SBCs in the ipsilateral AVCN and inhibitory glycinergic MNTB cell inputs activated by GBCs in the contralateral AVCN. The glycinergic inhibitory input to the LSO from the contralateral ear can be blocked by application of the glycine antagonist strychnine under binaural stimulation and mimicked by application of glycine with monaural ipsilateral stimulation”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=VMJPZII6) “The other LSO cell types project to the ipsi- or contralateral ICC and the DNLL”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=RVH3QCKB) “In summary, LSO cells show three projection patterns: an excitatory projection to the contralateral side and two ipsilateral projections, one excitatory and one inhibitory”
>> 
>> ### Medial Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body
>> 
>> The MNTB is the site of the calyces of Held, the synaptic terminals of GBC (?) axons from contralateral AVCN onto cell bodies of clycinergic MNTB principal cells. The synapse covers half of the cell surface, which receives also inhibitory inputs (maybe from GABA VNTB cells). Because it’s big, we can record both presynaptic calyceal terminal and postsynaptic MNTB cell
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=C6LZWXEP) “Despite the enormity of the terminal and its biophysical specializations, some studies have claimed this synapse to be prone to failures, but the extent of this phenomenon is controversial and perhaps species dependent.”
>> 
>> A “prepotential” (**what’s this**?) arises before the spike
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=4BCL34EE) “MNTB neurons displayed similar short membrane time constants, thanks to specialized ion channels with fast kinetics that make them ideally suited for rapid transmission of auditory information arriving via the giant synaptic terminals”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=4YLHL899) “for many years, it was debated as to whether humans have the MNTB and associated calyceal endings of Held (5, 36, 439), but recent findings (331, 332) describe at least some cells in the human that appear MNTBlike with a few calyceal endings”
>> 
>> ### Lateral Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body
>> 
>> The LNTB is ventral to LSO and lateral to MSO; some cells in it provide inhibition to MSO, CN, ICC; hypothesized to have a role in ITD tuning in MSO, but controversial. Some LNTB are monaural, others (mLNTB) are binaural and showed sensitivity to ITDs of stimulus fine structure or envelope
>> 
>> ### Other nuclei
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=HMM6UILG) “The VNTB receives a major descending projection from the ipsilateral ICC and external nucleus of the IC (18, 86, 669). The ICC projection terminates in a region of VNTB that overlaps with the site of origin of the MOC. Thus, ICC may be able to influence cochlear function via VNTB”
>> 
>> Apparently the SPN is implicated in sound localization as well, and innervates also the ICC and dorsal of IC.
>> 
>> # Neural Mechanisms of Sound Localization
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=DYQKXTQC) “For humans, the maximum ITD is about 800 μs, whereas for cats, with smaller heads, the maximum ITD is about 350 to 400 μs.”
>> 
>> Duplex theory: using ITD and ILD, ITDs at low frequencies and ILDs at high frequencies.
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=XT7W5PCC) “ILDs arise because the head acts as an effective shadow for high-frequency sounds, so that the amplitude of the sound to the near ear is greater than that to the far ear. ILDs are most effective at high frequencies because the wavelength of lowfrequency sounds is larger than the dimensions of the head.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=4KTB4CU3) “For more complex stimuli, such as amplitude-modulated tones, ITDs can be a salient cue even at high carrier frequencies since ANFs can phase-lock to the modulating envelope” ??? amplitude-modulated i guess means that the volume changes; the envelope... i still don't know what that is :(
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=FUDV49M9) “it is now generally agreed that another cue is necessary for localization of sources in the vertical dimension, namely the spectral cues provided by the filtering of sounds by the external pinna and head. The need for another cue can be appreciated by considering sounds that vary in spatial location in the midsagittal plane where all ITDs and ILDs are zero.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=QH5HHMQ7) “One would normally think that the spectral content in a sound would be a function of its source, not its location. However, sharp spectral notches such as those in the HRTF are unusual for natural sounds, and we will see below that there appear to be neural circuits that are specially adapted to detect such sharp notches”
>> 
>> ## Processing of interaural time disparities
>> 
>> ### Jeffress model
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=384RW6VV) “three basic assumptions: (i) inputs to a binaural nucleus carry timing information from each ear, (ii) the cells in the nucleus are coincidence detectors that respond maximally when the inputs from the two sides arrive at the same time, and (iii) the axonal inputs from the two sides are configured like delay lines to the array of binaural cells. The result of these assumptions is that there is a map of ITDs along the array of binaural cells.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=8RRIH987) “It is also important to note that models of auditory behavior that use auditory-nerve properties as their input without taking into account the transformation of temporal processing in AVCN are likely to underestimate temporal abilities.” is it talking about us? :D
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=P22R2SQF) “recent studies have found a dramatic increase in vector strength of both SBCs and GBCs at frequencies below about 1 kHz”
>> 
>> Seems like ITD sensitivity in MSO is pretty much certain, but [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1529&annotation=C35X4CSS) “Because of the difficulty in recording from the MSO mentioned above and the similarity with responses in the ICC, most studies of ITD sensitivity including ours have used recordings in the ICC as a proxy for studying MSO. However, given the number of convergent sources of inputs to the ICC, it is unlikely that any ICC responses truly reflect only MSO processing.”
>> 
>> ### Characteristic Delay
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1529&annotation=CH2K9PMT) “the delay “at which the periodic discharge curves for different frequencies reach the same relative amplitude.”” [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_phase)
>> 
>> CD-CP analysis has flown OVER my head
>> 
>> ### Sensitivity to ITDs of noise and clicks
>> 
>> ### Limitations of the Jeffress model
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=K68BME9C) “The evidence reviewed so far supports the first two basic assumptions of the Jeffress model: the presence of timing information in the afferents to the MSO and the presence of coincidence detectors in this nucleus”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=HJY3XXSV) “these two features are much less controversial than the third assumption (axonal delay lines), as well as the core prediction of the model [a spatial map of best delays (BDs)]” ma ha messo veramente le parentesi quadre per il secondo livello??
>> 
>> ## Alternatives
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=ILJZJVAV) “likely that the main mechanism of internal delay is effectively a phase-shifting mechanism rather than a pure time delay”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=MJP786J7) “a decrease in internal delay with increasing CF is a rather robust finding across species and studies”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=VRCKA28C) “Note that the early data, which at first sight show a π-limit (124, 519), consisted of responses to pure tones, which only allow assessment of a best interaural-phase modulo 2π: detection of internal delays larger than π requires analysis of responses over a range of frequencies (as in the CD analysis, Figure 13), or a stimulus containing a range of frequencies, such as broadband noise”
>> 
>> ### Schroeder
>> 
>> Delays that are present in the mechanical cochlear traveling wave could generate binaural internal delays:if a 500Hz tone were in the left suondfield, it would stimulate first left then right; if theinput from the controlateral selected a tonotopic location tuned to 480Hz, and the ipsilateral from a tonotopic location tuned to 520Hz, the longer cochlear delays would account for the overall delay to the MSO and bring coincidence
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=HCXMRIL6) “recently showed that axons in the LL, most likely derived from MSO neurons, indeed show such a bias, where frequency tuning of the contralateral ear tends to be lower in CF than tuning in the ipsilateral ear, and moreover the difference in frequency tuning was correlated to OD”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=IU8LLRPB) “Brand et al. (60) proposed that the inhibition provided by MNTB is the source of internal delay, the general concept being that leading inhibition can delay the effective excitatory phase of an EPSP.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=89N924PC) “The inhibitory input from MNTB is very well phase-locked (606): if within every stimulus cycle leading IPSPs delayed the EPSPs of the contralateral ear, the inhibition would effectively cause a phaseshift but only over the narrow frequency range of the cell’s response area”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=Y7WZZWHW) “Using a computational model, it was argued that such inhibition could generate ITD sensitivity to pure tones consistent with MSO responses”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=67QRAM3X) “The main evidence for a role of inhibition in creating internal delay comes from in vivo experiments in gerbil in which iontophoretic application of strychnine shifted ODs of MSO neurons in response to tones toward 0 ms (60). The interpretation was that the excitatory inputs from both ears arrive in-phase, and that the input from the contralateral ear was effectively delayed by the leading inhibitory input from MNTB, giving rise to a positive OD which was lost upon blockade of inhibition”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=L7TQ8NXY) “the response features shown in Brand et al. (60) before and after blockade suggested an effect on onset ITD rather than sustained ITD” “further analysis provided evidence for an effect on sustained ITDs”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=J3NS82SB) “the studies of the past decade that tested the hypothesis of Brand et al. (60) are in agreement refuting that specific hypothesis”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=4C6MRENM) “it seems premature to conclude that inhibition plays a dominant or even a minor role in the generation of internal delays”
>>

>> ## The cellular basis of coincidence detection
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=S7R3Z7JS) “Why is there a response (albeit generally low) to monaural stimulation, since an ideal coincidence detector should only give an output when there is an input from the two ears? Is inhibition needed to suppress responses to unfavorable ITDs to rates lower than spike rates evoked monaurally?”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=93PF356K) “A first answer to the first question is that SBCs generally have high spontaneous rates (605), and that phase-locked spikes driven by one ear can coincide with spontaneous spikes generated in the other ear. A second possibility are “autocoincidences”: inputs driven by the same ear converge and coincide. With regard to the second question, simple coincidence models show that the output of an MSO neuron can be entirely suppressed at unfavorable ITDs, without the need for inhibition, but that an additional suppression of autocoincidences is needed to generate realistic ITD functions”

>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=T2MRW5GS) “the timing of the subthreshold excitatory events determined ITD tuning” ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))
>> 
>> “in many neurons there was a phase offset between the timing of monaurally recorded subthreshold events and the ITD tuning of the same neuro”. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=AUXN847W) “Coincidence detection is therefore not instantaneous, with maximum probability of output when there is maximal alignment of inputs. Rather, recent input history interacts with intrinsic properties to determine the probability of firing. For example, a low level of depolarization which precedes a subsequent larger one can activate IKL and raise the spike threshold for this subsequent larger depolarization. In such cases, the best ITD can be different from the ITD where EPSPs are maximally aligned.”

>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=W6QX7J47) “Viewed from a wider perspective, much of the debate is part of a larger one in neuroscience regarding the role of neural tuning and the relative merits of high firing rates at the “peak” of the tuning curve versus high sensitivity to changes in stimulus parameter at the “slopes” of the tuning curve” ([Yin et al., 2019](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/KE4SCWB9))

>> ### McAlpine et al.:
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=S4CD2N4R) “A radically different stance, based on binaural ITD tuning observed in the IC of guinea pig, was taken by McAlpine et al. (419). The authors start from the observation that ITD functions are positioned such that their steepest slopes tend to be centered near 0 ITD: the main peak (at the OD) is at a positive ITD, with a neighboring trough at a negative ITD. Such positioning gives a maximal change in firing rate for changes in ITD over the relevant parameter range, here determined by the animal’s acoustic head width. A corollary of this feature is that ODs decrease with CF along a hyperbolic trajectory (Figure 19B). The authors then make a case for a “two-channel” or “hemispheric” model, in which there are two complementary, broad, ITD-tuned channels, set up in the two MSOs. In their view, the MSO works much like the LSO: a source at the midline equally activates both nuclei, and as its spatial position moves away from the midline, activity decreases in one nucleus and increases in the other.” “According to this view, the range of internal delays present at each CF is seen as “noise” rather than as a desirable feature.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=4DPCTPWN) “However, a strict two-channel view is untenable. Perhaps the simplest counterexamples are stimuli that are symmetric, that is do not lead or lag in left or right ear, but still evoke different spatial perceptions.”

>> ## Processing of interaural level disparities (ILDs)
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1543&annotation=2DTVTFJV) “LSO cells receive excitatory input from SBCs in the ipsilateral AVCN and glycinergic inhibitory input from cells in the ipsilateral MNTB, which in turn receive excitation from GBCs in the contralateral AVCN”
>> 
>> ### Inhibition and Excitation (IE) in the LSO
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1543&annotation=FLS2BIHL) “Most studies of the LSO have demonstrated the ILD sensitivity by the decreased response resulting from increasing the level of sound to the contralateral ear while holding the excitatory drive to the ipsilateral ear constant”: the more the contra is stimulated (higher level), the lower the overall rate -> the contra is inhibiting
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1544&annotation=RVTKRXB2) “While such measurements definitively establish the inhibitory input resulting from stimulation of the contralateral ear, they do not mimic the natural changes in SPL when a sound source moves in free field around the subject. The latter is more closely approximated by varying the ILD while holding the average binaural level (ABL) constant.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1544&annotation=6NQVIULN) “While it is generally acknowledged that LSO cells process ILDs, there are studies showing that they are also sensitive to ITDs, especially for stimuli to which the high-frequency LSO cells can phase-lock, such as amplitude-modulated tones”

>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=6DXBQ2XG) “The anatomical properties of the afferent circuit to LSO also contain features that suggest timing is important”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=6R8MUAX8) “the latency of the inhibition arising from stimulation of the contralateral ear was surprisingly similar to the excitation from the ipsilateral side, and this observation has been confirmed by many subsequent studies”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=KPCR3DCI) “This suggests that the ipsilateral excitation was delayed relative to the contralateral inhibition by about 170 μs.”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=T7CT2IHP) “Remarkably, all of the estimates of differences in the timing of input to the LSO from the two sides indicate that the contralateral inhibition arrives, on average, about 0.2 ms later than the ipsilateral excitation.”

>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=2LX6EHIV) “as is the case for pure tones, the ITD sensitivities of MSO and LSO are distinctly different due to coincident interaction in MSO and the subtractive or anticoincident mechanism in LSO”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=4IGYQUNE) “The development of the virtual space technique has allowed manipulation of the three localization cues independently (139, 345, 346). Since ITDs and ILDs generally involve cells with different frequency ranges, such manipulations are of most utility when exploring the effects of ILDs and spectra.”

>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=VEEEC9HK) “One problem for establishing a space map is that the ITD tuning found in the MSO and ICC is broad as mentioned above. There is evidence that the tuning improves, that is gets narrower, at higher centers from the MSO to ICC to medial geniculate and auditory cortex (164, 165). The problem with broadly tuned maps is especially acute for animals with small heads, which has led to the observation that in gerbils and guinea pigs, the ITD curves tend to peak near or outside the physiological range with the related proposal of the two-channel model discussed above”
>> 
>> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=YA7SGHDQ) “The poor evidence for a space map suggests that other coding strategies may be involved, such as by distributed coding across populations of neurons or by use of other response features such as spike timing”

>> 
>> Generally agreed upon:

>> 1. localization of broadband signals is more accurate than tones
>> 2. spectral cues are essential for vertical dimension localization

### introduction
- & In the other two major sensory systems of vision and somatosensation, the location of the stimulus is naturally encoded on the sensory epithelium: on the retina for vision and on the body surface for somatosensation. [(p. 1504)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1504&annotation=TPVGMRMH)
- & the auditory system has no information about the spatial location from the basilar membrane where the inner hair cells (IHCs) are arrayed [(p. 1504)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1504&annotation=EJ986YW4)
- & human subjects can detect interaural time differences of around 10 μs (320), almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the duration of the individual action potentials used to encode the sound [(p. 1504)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1504&annotation=ZG8YMGWI)
- & we will not discuss processing at levels above the midbrain [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=5XXVF565)
- & The development of brain slices has expanded our knowledge of the properties of different ion channels and has strengthened our classification schemes of different cell types. Recent d [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=6Q8S757Y)
- & We include some seminal studies in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC), but otherwise processing in more rostral structures [nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (LL), ICC, thalamus, and cortex] is beyond the scope of this article, though these systems are obviously critical to the brain’s ability to localize sounds [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=JPS7HWEJ)
### tuning and timing in the auditory nerve
### anatomy of the auditory nerve
- & About 90% of the fibers in the auditory component of the VIIIth cranial nerve are classified as afferents that originate from the spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea of each inner ear and project information from the cochlea to the central nervous system. The remaining 10% constitute the efferent system, which carries signals from the brainstem back to the cochlea [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=23KJ275E)
- & irtually all references to auditory responses of ANFs are undoubtedly recordings from type I fibers. Type II fibers are much more difficult to record from, and although the anatomy of their projection is known, virtually no information is available about their response properties. A few early reports indicate that type II fibers are insensitive to sound [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=J553V253)
- & may instead respond when there is sound-induced outer hair cell damage. Thus, this input may be transmitting nociceptive information centrally [(p. 1505)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1505&annotation=UJQR77UA)
- & The function of the efferents is beyond the scope of this article [(p. 1506)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1506&annotation=BLPVLY7C)
#### frequency tuning
- & Essentially, the PSTH shows the probability of a spike relative to stimulus onset [(p. 1506)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1506&annotation=4CYRBXTS)
- & Invariably, electrophysiological recordings from neurons rely on temporal averaging of many repetitions of a sound to infer the probability of response of a cell. Clearly the nervous system does not rely on many repetitions of the same stimulus to deduce the sound and its properties. The underlying assumption is that the temporal averaging used in single cell recording mimics the spatial averaging of many fibers with the same properties in the brain.

- & classified by spontaneous activity are not due to differences in IHC properties, that is there are no highand low-spontaneous IHCs [(p. 1507)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1507&annotation=PKU4HFTT)
#### temporal processing
##### phase-locking
- & The functional polarization of the hair cell stereocilia causes the hair cell to be depolarized with movement of the hair bundle toward the tallest stereocilia and hyperpolarized when moved in the opposite direction [(p. 1507)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1507&annotation=PE7FV44H)
- & In mammals, for stimulus frequencies above about 3 to 5 kHz, the AC component essentially disappears, leaving just the DC component [(p. 1508)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=HYKHTQ59)
- & Phase-locking is usually quantified by the vector strength metric (199), which varies between 0 (all histogram bins equal, or no preferred phase) and 1 (all spikes fall into one bin) and is labeled R in Figure 2B. In all mammals studied, the vector strength is high at low frequencies and drops off at high frequencies, usually becoming insignificant above 3 to 5 kHz. [(p. 1508)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=NN7BYJSI)
- & for two-tone complexes, the ANFs will phase-lock to one or both of the tones, depending on the relative magnitude of each component (245). [(p. 1508)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=5WMTR9VB)
- & However, high-frequency ANFs can phase-lock to the envelope of complex stimuli, such as a sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tone (263, 280, 289, 434, 485, 610, 611, 718). [(p. 1508)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=J6YJ7Q4X)
##### reverse correlation
- & averaging the stimulus waveform preceding each spike, typically over many thousands of spikes. Intuitively, the revcor function shows if there was some characteristic in the stimulus, both in the spectral and temporal domains, which led to a spike [(p. 1508)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1508&annotation=HMHBTIG4)
##### autocorrelograms
- **what? the "temporal feature" is just when the spike happens, no? wtf?**:
	- & The brain can obviously not resort to such strategies to extract temporal features in spike trains [(p. 1509)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1509&annotation=KLAK8CDJ)

- **for later**:
	- & Thus, SACs and related displays provide a simple means to compare temporal patterns in responses of monaural neurons to any arbitrary stimulus and indeed they show strong similarities with responses of the binaural coincidence detectors such as that found in the MSO and ICC (386, 387) (compare Figure 3I with Figures 16B and 17). For further discussion, see Ref. 278 [(p. 1511)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1511&annotation=A642SS9Q)
### overview of the brainstem auditory pathways
#### cochlear nucleus
- **the note should fill in the rest of the story**:
	- & The CN receives all synaptic terminal endings generated by ANFs [(p. 1511)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1511&annotation=EQLSMF8F)
- & The auditory-nerve bundle enters the nucleus at the nerve root area (NRA), which subdivides AVCN and posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN). [(p. 1511)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1511&annotation=NGPDKZT4)
- & Indeed, the responses of the bushy cells are often called “primary-like” because of their similarity to the primary input from ANFs [(p. 1512)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1512&annotation=HMNUJ5Y3)
#### ventral cochlear nucleus
- & VCN has four with subcategories in two of these: bushy, stellate, octopus, and nerve root cells. [(p. 1512)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1512&annotation=DJXVR6UF)
##### bushy cells
- & Glutamatergic bushy cells represent the major cell type populating the AVCN, [(p. 1512)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1512&annotation=ECA88FKD)
- & The bushy cell population can be subdivided based on AN inputs, cell body shape, AVCN location, and projection patterns into globular bushy cell (GBC) and spherical bushy cell (SBC) [(p. 1512)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1512&annotation=LA7BES29)

- & The excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited by end bulbs are often, but not always, suprathreshold (403), and the probability of end bulbgenerated spikes can be reduced by the inhibitory input [(p. 1513)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1513&annotation=VK24WARL)
- & GBCs are situated even further caudally in the AVCN in the NRA. The ANF terminals on the GBCs (the “modified end bulbs of Held”) are large and somatic but more numerous than on SBCs, about 20/cell but sometimes [(p. 1513)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1513&annotation=HNBDH5W3)
- & bushy cells had an unusual onset firing to depolarizing current pulses. Subsequently, the onset response was shown to be due to a specialized set of currents, namely IKL and IH, that confer a short membrane time constant, which makes EPSPs decay faster and prevents summation of successive events [(p. 1514)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1514&annotation=RRRSZ9KG)
- & An outcome of the short time constant is that either very large individual synaptic events (to SBCs and MNTB neurons) or very coincident subthreshold synaptic events (to GBCs and OCs) are required to generate a spike output.

- & respond primarily when the subthreshold inputs arrive at the same time, typically at the onset of high rate input generating what is known as a primary-like-with-notch response (58) at high frequencies (Figure 6) or a phase-locked response at low frequencies. The notch is created by a very well-timed initial spike due to the coincidence of inputs and the refractory period following the first spike.

- & T- and D-stellates both fire repetitively to depolarizing current pulses but can be distinguished by their postspike afterhyperpolarizations with T-stellates showing a single and D-stellates a double undershoot [(p. 1514)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1514&annotation=YHW79XKV)

- & slowing of the membrane time constant also affects the subthreshold synaptic responses generated by a tone allowing them to temporally summate ANF inputs and maintain a sustained depolarization, leading to well-timed repetitive regular firing often referred to as chopping [(p. 1515)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1515&annotation=9MJWI8U4)

- & OCs also have a low-voltage-activated K current (IKL) and an opposing hyperpolarization-activated cation current (IH). These currents are very large, and as a result the OCs have a very short membrane time constant and low input resistance. Thus, as in bushy cells, in response to positive current pulses, OCs respond only at current onset. [(p. 1516)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1516&annotation=WXYFX32C)

- & Such high levels of spontaneously active synaptic convergence would produce significant depolarization in other neurons causing high-spontaneous spiking, but leakiness of the resting cell membrane shunts these synaptic currents and minimizes the chances of random simultaneous EPSPs reaching threshold [(p. 1516)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1516&annotation=C87KCQPM)

##### medial superior olive
- & The primary inhibitory inputs to MSO are from neurons in the MNTB and LNTB on the same side that synapse primarily on the principal cell body [(p. 1521)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=ZVIAVJWS)
- & In gerbil, it is estimated that an MSO principal cell receives a minimum of 4 to 8 excitatory inputs and 2 to 4 inhibitory inputs [(p. 1521)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=9UPCFA5P)
- & In ICC, their round vesicle-containing terminals synapse on cells predominantly in the low-frequency lamina (379, 474) overlapping with terminals from ipsilateral, but not contralateral, LSO [(p. 1521)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1521&annotation=YSGJQDSQ)
- & Remarkably, stimulation of the ipsilateral or contralateral AN in a thick slice that retains connections from AN to SOC (532, 533) elicits an IPSP that arrives at the MSO before the EPSP despite an additional synapse in the inhibitory pathway.

##### lateral superior olive
- & (i) SBCs and (ii) T-stellate neurons of the ipsilateral VCN, (iii) principal neurons in the MNTB on the same side which are providing inhibitory input from the GBCs of the contralateral side, and (iv) small multipolar neurons in the contralateral VNTB [(p. 1522)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=ZPJ85LJD)
- & The strongest inputs are thought to be involved in the sound localization process: excitatory glutamatergic inputs from SBCs in the ipsilateral AVCN and inhibitory glycinergic MNTB cell inputs activated by GBCs in the contralateral AVCN. The glycinergic inhibitory input to the LSO from the contralateral ear can be blocked by application of the glycine antagonist strychnine under binaural stimulation and mimicked by application of glycine with monaural ipsilateral stimulation [(p. 1522)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=8HUD39EA)
- & The other LSO cell types project to the ipsi- or contralateral ICC and the DNLL [(p. 1522)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=VMJPZII6)

##### medial nucleus of the trapezoid body
- & calyces of Held are the synaptic terminals of GBC axons from the contralateral AVCN onto the cell bodies of glycinergic MNTB principal cells [(p. 1522)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=Y6E48QR8)
- & The size of the calyceal synapse has permitted scientists to record from the presynaptic calyceal terminal and the postsynaptic MNTB cell at the same time, making it ideal for studying the basic principles of synaptic transmission [(p. 1522)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1522&annotation=WHN7VIRD)
- & Despite the enormity of the terminal and its biophysical specializations, some studies have claimed this synapse to be prone to failures (324, 384), but the extent of this phenomenon is controversial and perhaps species dependent (149, 415). [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=C6LZWXEP)
- & the MNTB functions as a prominent inhibitory interneuron relaying from the contralateral ear to several nuclei in the SOC [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=M74ZMBVZ)
- & Identification of MNTB principal cells from in vivo recordings (221–223, 606) is aided by the presence of a prepotential presumed to arise from the large calyx (502). The prepotential is particularly striking when recording with metal microelectrodes, as compared with sharp intracellular glass microelectrodes, and, in cat, is invariably followed by a postsynaptic spike (606). In rare cases, during spontaneous activity, the postsynaptic spike may be seen without a prepotential. Responses of these cells to contralateral tones were similar to their GBC input, showing the secure and rapid transmission through the Calyx of Held synapse [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=8KFKZN26)
- & MNTB neurons displayed similar short membrane time constants, thanks to specialized ion channels with fast kinetics that make them ideally suited for rapid transmission of auditory information arriving via the giant synaptic terminals [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=4BCL34EE)
- & for many years, it was debated as to whether humans have the MNTB and associated calyceal endings of Held (5, 36, 439), but recent findings (331, 332) describe at least some cells in the human that appear MNTBlike with a few calyceal endings [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=4YLHL899)
##### lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body
- & Some cells in LNTB are glycinergic and provide inhibition to its targets, which include the MSO, CN, and the ICC (4, 78, 122, 459, 614, 617). The LNTB has been hypothesized to have a role in ITD tuning in MSO (450), though this role is still controversial [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=IXSMHZIR)
- & Surprisingly, mLNTB cells were often binaural and could even show sensitivity to ITDs of stimulus fine structure or envelope [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=4CWG65NW)
- & Whether these neurons create ITD sensitivity de novo and are a primary site of coincidence detection or whether they inherit it from inputs remains to be determined. Some of them also showed enhanced phase-locking to tones delivered in the tuning curve tai [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=NZHN767D)
##### other nuclei
- & The VNTB receives a major descending projection from the ipsilateral ICC and external nucleus of the IC (18, 86, 669). The ICC projection terminates in a region of VNTB that overlaps with the site of origin of the MOC. Thus, ICC may be able to influence cochlear function via VNTB [(p. 1523)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1523&annotation=HMM6UILG)
- & The superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN) (also abbreviated SPON or DMPO) is probably the most prominent PO nucleus in most species including human (333, 442, 614, 678). SPN is located next to the LSO medially, dorsal to the MSO and MNTB. Neurons here have been implicated in several important auditory functions including sound localization (137), duration coding (294, 335), gap detection (293), and forward masking (188).

### neural mechanisms of sound localization
#### acoustic cues for sound localization
- & For humans, the maximum ITD is about 800 μs, whereas for cats, with smaller heads, the maximum ITD is about 350 to 400 μs. [(p. 1524)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=DYQKXTQC)
- & ILDs arise because the head acts as an effective shadow for high-frequency sounds, so that the amplitude of the sound to the near ear is greater than that to the far ear. ILDs are most effective at high frequencies because the wavelength of lowfrequency sounds is larger than the dimensions of the head. [(p. 1524)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=XT7W5PCC)
- **??? amplitude-modulated i guess means that the volume changes; the envelope... i still don't know what that is :(**:
	- & For more complex stimuli, such as amplitude-modulated tones, ITDs can be a salient cue even at high carrier frequencies since ANFs can phase-lock to the modulating envelope [(p. 1524)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1524&annotation=4KTB4CU3)
- & it is now generally agreed that another cue is necessary for localization of sources in the vertical dimension, namely the spectral cues provided by the filtering of sounds by the external pinna and head. The need for another cue can be appreciated by considering sounds that vary in spatial location in the midsagittal plane where all ITDs and ILDs are zero. [(p. 1525)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=FUDV49M9)
- & One would normally think that the spectral content in a sound would be a function of its source, not its location. However, sharp spectral notches such as those in the HRTF are unusual for natural sounds, and we will see below that there appear to be neural circuits that are specially adapted to detect such sharp notches [(p. 1525)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=QH5HHMQ7)
##### processing of interaural time disparities
###### the jeffress model
- & three basic assumptions: (i) inputs to a binaural nucleus carry timing information from each ear, (ii) the cells in the nucleus are coincidence detectors that respond maximally when the inputs from the two sides arrive at the same time, and (iii) the axonal inputs from the two sides are configured like delay lines to the array of binaural cells. The result of these assumptions is that there is a map of ITDs along the array of binaural cells. [(p. 1525)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=384RW6VV)
- & there is considerable dispute over the existence of delay lines and poor evidence of a map of ITDs in the MSO [(p. 1525)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1525&annotation=9FBG47BN)

- & Since the inputs to the MSO and LSO are relayed through the bushy cells of the AVCN, an important point is whether that input is significantly different from its auditory-nerve input [(p. 1527)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=LE2TECXP)
- & The bushy cells [(p. 1527)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=U74A85SH)

- & However, more recent studies have found a dramatic increase in vector strength of both SBCs and GBCs at frequencies below about 1 kHz [(p. 1527)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=P22R2SQF)

- & It is not clear why the many earlier studies (58, 354, 696), several of which were primarily aimed at determining whether the phase-locking of AVCN cells was different from that of ANFs, failed to find the synchrony enhancement. [(p. 1527)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1527&annotation=WHBKHMY9)
- **is it talking about us? :D**:
	- & It is also important to note that models of auditory behavior that use auditory-nerve properties as their input without taking into account the transformation of temporal processing in AVCN are likely to underestimate temporal abilities.

- **hilarious**:
	- & recordings from the dog where the nucleus is folded and thicker, and they had a better chance of encountering a cell. Still, recording from the MSO was difficult, as all of the five figures in the paper (199) illustrating ITD sensitivity were taken from a single cell (though 15 cells were studied), and all recordings from the MSO in several different animals were obtained using the same electrode (Goldberg, personal communication). [(p. 1528)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1528&annotation=C8R8QA2K)

- & The ipsilateral response is leading the contralateral response by 0.15 cycles. The prediction for binaural stimulation is that the cell would respond maximally when the contralateral stimulus is given a phase lead of 0.15 cycles, or equivalently 150 μs. [(p. 1528)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1528&annotation=9VYC3VWH)
- & Because of the difficulty in recording from the MSO mentioned above and the similarity with responses in the ICC, most studies of ITD sensitivity including ours have used recordings in the ICC as a proxy for studying MSO. However, given the number of convergent sources of inputs to the ICC, it is unlikely that any ICC responses truly reflect only MSO processing.

- & Overall, in the ICC, most of the cells had CDs that were within ±300 μs, which covers the physiological range of ITDs in the cat.

- & One of the merits of the CD analysis is that the values of CD and CP have physiological meaning. The CD is the difference in the conduction time between the inputs from the two ears to the point of binaural interaction [(p. 1529)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1529&annotation=UGB2FARV)
- & Cells in the LSO that receive excitation from one side and inhibition from the other have CP = 0.5, reflecting the fact that one input is 180∘ out-of-phase with the other [(p. 1530)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1530&annotation=72WFWMKK)
- & The binaural-beat stimulus is created by delivering tones of slightly different frequencies to the two ears [(p. 1531)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1531&annotation=ET9RF7MA)
- & Rayleigh showed that human subjects not only detect the beat frequency but also experience a sensation of movement within the head of the tone from one ear to another [(p. 1532)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1532&annotation=ZTJPJTUJ)
- & Rayleigh correctly inferred that the detection of the beat frequency meant that human subjects are sensitive to the interaural phase of the tones to the two ears. Furthermore, the sensation of movement from one ear to another suggested that this phenomenon was involved in sound localization [(p. 1532)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1532&annotation=XX66MMA2)
- & Experimentally, the binaural-beat stimulus is much more efficient than using ITDs (349, 541) since on each fb cycle, all possible interaural phases are presented [(p. 1533)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1533&annotation=A3WRAEKA)
###### sensitivity to itds of noise and clicks
- & While tones are a useful stimulus to probe interaural sensitivity, they are very unnatural and rarely heard outside the lab. Natural sounds have a broad spectral distribution, so it is of interest to probe the sensitivity to ITDs of broadband signals [(p. 1533)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1533&annotation=WU8KT93D)
- & In a linear system, the response to a broadband signal can be predicted from the summed response to its spectral components. [(p. 1533)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1533&annotation=LSLYYRG3)
- & In Figure 16B, all of the curves in Figure 16A are averaged together to obtain the composite curve (labeled Tones) and compared with the response to ITDs of a broadband noise stimulus [(p. 1533)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1533&annotation=RLWTH7YJ)
- & These results suggest that the different spectral components of a complex sound are summed in a roughly linear fashion [(p. 1533)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1533&annotation=6LDV467H)

- & the noise ITD functions are broadly tuned in ITD compared to the natural range of possible ITDs based on head size, and of course this is especially true for animals with small heads [(p. 1534)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=I9ZSKVSE)
- & It has been recognized for some time that the coincidence model of interaural interaction can be seen as a special case of a more general model of running cross-correlation [(p. 1534)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=GCWQB2PY)
##### limitations of the jeffress model
- & The evidence reviewed so far supports the first two basic assumptions of the Jeffress model: the presence of timing information in the afferents to the MSO and the presence of coincidence detectors in this nucleus [(p. 1534)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=K68BME9C)
- **ma ha messo veramente le parentesi quadre per il secondo livello??**:
	- & these two features are much less controversial than the third assumption (axonal delay lines), as well as the core prediction of the model [a spatial map of best delays (BDs)] [(p. 1534)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1534&annotation=HJY3XXSV)
- & When the internal delay exactly compensates for the external, acoustic delay (i.e. the ITD), coincident activation of the binaural detector is reached [(p. 1535)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1535&annotation=8D3R6FKH)
- & A first, simple, outcome of Jeffress’ proposal is the presence of a range of internal delays [(p. 1535)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1535&annotation=6Y79UNIQ)
- & A deeper prediction of Jeffress’ model is that internal delays are ordered along a spatial dimension of the nucleus containing the primary coincidence detectors [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=Y3DJGYSC)
- & this has been a very difficult question to examine, and only two studies had a large enough sample of anatomically localized recordings to check [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=SUUU3I6P)
- & Importantly, these anatomical findings predicted a gradient of internal delays in a direction consistent with the data of Yin and Chan (722), that is with increasing OD toward the caudal pole of the MSO [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=4PL9CMNE)
- & However, binaural studies in the IC of guinea pig (418, 419) revealed properties that were difficult to reconcile with the Jeffress model [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=RPGNJMQ4)
- & they discovered a relationship between OD and CF: large ODs were only found in neurons tuned to low frequencies, and OD magnitude decreased with increasing CF [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=73XZQ7UZ)
- & Another study, which obtained multiunit recordings in the MSO of cat in the course of anatomical experiments (475), also did not find support for such a gradient [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=FX5LB33K)
- & Overall, the evidence for axonal delays (in the form of length differences) providing the main source of internal delay and, more importantly, for a map of internal delays along the long axis of the MSO, is presently weak at best. [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=3JJIJQ5K)
- & technical limitations have hindered a straightforward test of the main tenet of the Jeffress model. One severe limitation is that all evidence so far has required the pooling of data across animals. Final verdict awaits a technique that allows imaging of the activity of the entire nucleus in response to sound with different ITDs, within a single animal [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=KFB5LWX8)
##### the source of internal delays
- & There are two compelling sets of observations, made across species and nuclei (MSO, DNLL, and ICC), that suggest that the source of internal delay is not (only) a “pure time” delay, [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=FQGXCP3S)
- & A first consistent finding, particularly in the IC, is that a significant subset of cells displays binaural phase differences that cannot be reduced to a pure time delay [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=MDS5RFJ4)
- & A second consistent finding is the observation [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=L7QGTWSY)
- & that there is an upper limit in the largest internal delays which roughly equals half of the characteristic period (CF−1) and is referred to as the “π-limit” [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=6XAIXHGV)
- & there is no inherent reason why axonal delays would result in a π-limited distribution [(p. 1536)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1536&annotation=3LR8XNEB)
- & likely that the main mechanism of internal delay is effectively a phase-shifting mechanism rather than a pure time delay [(p. 1537)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=ILJZJVAV)
- & a decrease in internal delay with increasing CF is a rather robust finding across species and studies [(p. 1537)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=MJP786J7)
- & Note that the early data, which at first sight show a π-limit (124, 519), consisted of responses to pure tones, which only allow assessment of a best interaural-phase modulo 2π: detection of internal delays larger than π requires analysis of responses over a range of frequencies (as in the CD analysis, Figure 13), or a stimulus containing a range of frequencies, such as broadband noise [(p. 1537)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=VRCKA28C)
- & although the inverse relationship between OD and CF first reported for guinea pig IC by McAlpine et al. (418, 419) was confirmed in other species, the lack of small ODs at the lowest CFs that they reported is not present in other species [(p. 1537)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1537&annotation=5KY5RAZ2)
- & Schroeder (568) proposed that the delays that are present in the mechanical cochlear traveling wave could generate binaural internal delays. [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=96HL9LV4)
- & If now the input from the contralateral side derived its input from a tonotopic location tuned to, for example 480 Hz, and that from the ipsilateral side from a location tuned to, for example 520 Hz, an internal delay would arise from the longer cochlear delay to the contralateral inputs, which could compensate for the ITD and bring the inputs to MSO into coincidenc [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=9ERJLIZN)
- & Physiological tests of Schroeder’s proposal have been limited [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=M92Z9LES)
- & These results suggested that the OD versus CF distribution therefore results from “errors” in innervation, which create small cochlear disparities between the inputs to coincidence detectors. [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=EQIV7CBE)
- & major difficulty with this scheme is that the errors need to be biased (contra CF < ipsi CF) to explain the positive bias in ODs, [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=7JA9N5M4)
- & recently showed that axons in the LL, most likely derived from MSO neurons, indeed show such a bias, where frequency tuning of the contralateral ear tends to be lower in CF than tuning in the ipsilateral ear, and moreover the difference in frequency tuning was correlated to OD [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=HCXMRIL6)
- & Brand et al. (60) proposed that the inhibition provided by MNTB is the source of internal delay, the general concept being that leading inhibition can delay the effective excitatory phase of an EPSP. [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=IU8LLRPB)
- & The inhibitory input from MNTB is very well phase-locked (606): if within every stimulus cycle leading IPSPs delayed the EPSPs of the contralateral ear, the inhibition would effectively cause a phaseshift but only over the narrow frequency range of the cell’s response area [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=89N924PC)
- & Using a computational model, it was argued that such inhibition could generate ITD sensitivity to pure tones consistent with MSO responses [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=Y7WZZWHW)
- & The main evidence for a role of inhibition in creating internal delay comes from in vivo experiments in gerbil in which iontophoretic application of strychnine shifted ODs of MSO neurons in response to tones toward 0 ms (60). The interpretation was that the excitatory inputs from both ears arrive in-phase, and that the input from the contralateral ear was effectively delayed by the leading inhibitory input from MNTB, giving rise to a positive OD which was lost upon blockade of inhibition [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=67QRAM3X)
- & Several authors criticized the fast IPSP time course that was assumed in the computational model of Brand et al. (60) as being unrealistic [(p. 1538)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1538&annotation=P4B33554)
- & the response features shown in Brand et al. (60) before and after blockade suggested an effect on onset ITD rather than sustained ITD [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=L7TQ8NXY)
- & further analysis (500) provided evidence for an effect on sustained ITDs [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=7KNSSAKU)
- & Although IPSPs could not be directly observed with this technique, the variance in the recorded signal was lowest at unfavorable IPDs (lower than during spontaneous activity), which was interpreted as a lack of phase-locked inhibition preceding the EPSPs [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=G4T2NMAM)
- & In vivo intracellular recordings, also in gerbil, also failed to provide clear evidence for sustained, phase-locked inhibition [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=838MGJIN)
- & The dominant effect of inhibition was at sound onset rather than in the sustained part of the response, which did not always show phase-locked IPSPs [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=2BMMSEBZ)
- & leading IPSPs were observed for both ipsi- and contralateral synaptic stimulation [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=NNMAAJU5)
- & a delaying effect of MNTB inputs was not observed [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=3BSCF2TP)
- & leading inhibition had indeed only minimal effects on the timing of the peak of the ensuing EPSP [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=8IB22N67)
- & the studies of the past decade that tested the hypothesis of Brand et al. (60) are in agreement refuting that specific hypothesis [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=J3NS82SB)
- & it seems premature to conclude that inhibition plays a dominant or even a minor role in the generation of internal delays [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=4C6MRENM)
- & Nevertheless, the inhibitory inputs are certainly present, and their role remains an intriguing question [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=EGSAU3QC)
- & Even in juxtacellular and whole-cell recordings (177, 664), inhibition is virtually undetectable [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=F8GSWAF7)

- & a general hypothesis that the inhibitory inputs, which show fluctuations in rate similar to the excitatory inputs that converge on the same MSO neurons, act to make the MSO neurons even leakier than they already are in their resting state [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=J7TCMD96)
- & Perhaps extra “leakiness” (through inhibitory inputs) is important to counter temporal summation in time windows in which there is a lot of excitation. [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=N9NIY3EH)
- & there is still a theoretical possibility that delay lines àlaJeffress would be tailored to CF, [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=P3K2REKL)
- & this anatomical gradient would not explain the presence of nonzero CP values or the asymmetry of many noise-delay functions, and the available anatomical data on the axonal projections to MSO are not consistent with the simple CF-dependent length differences that would be required by such a scheme [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=6LFLGEDX)
- & Resolution of this topic will likely require the use of new techniques [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=LIZP2Q9B)
##### the cellular basis of coincidence detection
- & a coincidence count on contra- and ipsilateral monaural responses to broadband noise captures the shape of the ITD function of the same MSO neuron to the noise presented binaurally [(p. 1540)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1540&annotation=P4PB3A5J)
- & Why is there a response (albeit generally low) to monaural stimulation, since an ideal coincidence detector should only give an output when there is an input from the two ears? Is inhibition needed to suppress responses to unfavorable ITDs to rates lower than spike rates evoked monaurally? [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=S7R3Z7JS)
- & A first answer to the first question is that SBCs generally have high spontaneous rates (605), and that phase-locked spikes driven by one ear can coincide with spontaneous spikes generated in the other ear. A second possibility are “autocoincidences”: inputs driven by the same ear converge and coincide. With regard to the second question, simple coincidence models show that the output of an MSO neuron can be entirely suppressed at unfavorable ITDs, without the need for inhibition, but that an additional suppression of autocoincidences is needed to generate realistic ITD functions [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=93PF356K)
- **usually they aren't?**:
	- & The dynamics and spatial distribution of the intrinsic conductances counteract passive cable properties of the thick dendrites so that EPSPs are spike-like at the soma [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=GF5XJQNZ)
- & sensitivity to rate of depolarization makes it so that only fast-rising coincident events cause spiking. [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=R8VGTF7V)
- & the timing of the subthreshold excitatory events determined ITD tuning [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=T2MRW5GS)
- & in many neurons there was a phase offset between the timing of monaurally recorded subthreshold events and the ITD tuning of the same neuron [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=7G9BSYMM)
- & Coincidence detection is therefore not instantaneous, with maximum probability of output when there is maximal alignment of inputs. Rather, recent input history interacts with intrinsic properties to determine the probability of firing. For example, a low level of depolarization which precedes a subsequent larger one can activate IKL and raise the spike threshold for this subsequent larger depolarization. In such cases, the best ITD can be different from the ITD where EPSPs are maximally aligned. [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=AUXN847W)
###### heterogeneity in internal delays: feature or bug?
- & it can be questioned whether the focus on ODs is justified [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=6FLI8S56)
- & A radically different stance, based on binaural ITD tuning observed in the IC of guinea pig, was taken by McAlpine et al. (419). The authors start from the observation that ITD functions are positioned such that their steepest slopes tend to be centered near 0 ITD: the main peak (at the OD) is at a positive ITD, with a neighboring trough at a negative ITD. Such positioning gives a maximal change in firing rate for changes in ITD over the relevant parameter range, here determined by the animal’s acoustic head width. A corollary of this feature is that ODs decrease with CF along a hyperbolic trajectory (Figure 19B). The authors then make a case for a “two-channel” or “hemispheric” model, in which there are two complementary, broad, ITD-tuned channels, set up in the two MSOs. In their view, the MSO works much like the LSO: a source at the midline equally activates both nuclei, and as its spatial position moves away from the midline, activity decreases in one nucleus and increases in the other. [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=S4CD2N4R)
- & According to this view, the range of internal delays present at each CF is seen as “noise” rather than as a desirable feature. [(p. 1541)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1541&annotation=IYLINU4P)
- & However, a strict two-channel view is untenable. Perhaps the simplest counterexamples are stimuli that are symmetric, that is do not lead or lag in left or right ear, but still evoke different spatial perceptions. [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=4DPCTPWN)
- & physiologically inspired computational modeling studies have argued that heterogeneous ITD tuning, that is a diversity of ODs at each CF, is critical to explain perceptual results, and increasingly so for more realistic, complex acoustic environments [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=GNAC9QIW)
- & It was also pointed out (273, 287) that the requirements for sensitivity to interaural decorrelation [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=9TVDKLUF)
- & are orthogonal to those for ITD discrimination: while neurons are most sensitive to changes in ITD at the steep slopes of their ITD-tuning curves, they are most sensitive to changes in interaural correlation at their peaks [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=RGAEM8CN)
- & Thus, sensitivity to interaural correlation suggests that neurons with their peaks centered near 0 ITD are useful, and indeed such neurons are present at all CFs in all species examined other than guinea pig. [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=X2VKIGC8)
- & Another criticism has been that the “physiological range” of ITDs is more of an abstraction than a fixed quantity and that realistic ITDs are quite frequency dependent and larger than suggested by simple interaural distance [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=PVKZPGEY)
- & A final objection that has been raised against a hemispheric model are behavioral data after unilateral midbrain lesions [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=JGMGYXDC)
- & A remaining capacity for sound localization in one hemisphere after a unilateral midbrain lesion is not easily reconciled with the required comparison of activity in the two hemispheres that is the basis of the two-channel model, and is more in line with a model making use of neurons tuned to different (contralateral) ODs [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=YSIPENAV)
- & Viewed from a wider perspective, much of the debate is part of a larger one in neuroscience regarding the role of neural tuning and the relative merits of high firing rates at the “peak” of the tuning curve versus high sensitivity to changes in stimulus parameter at the “slopes” of the tuning curve [(p. 1542)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1542&annotation=W6QX7J47)

- & While such measurements definitively establish the inhibitory input resulting from stimulation of the contralateral ear, they do not mimic the natural changes in SPL when a sound source moves in free field around the subject. The latter is more closely approximated by varying the ILD while holding the average binaural level (ABL) constant. [(p. 1544)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1544&annotation=RVTKRXB2)
- & While it is generally acknowledged that LSO cells process ILDs, there are studies showing that they are also sensitive to ITDs, especially for stimuli to which the high-frequency LSO cells can phase-lock, such as amplitude-modulated tones [(p. 1544)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1544&annotation=6NQVIULN)
- & To test which of the three localization acoustic cues (ITD, ILD, and spectrum) are more effective in shaping the receptive fields of LSO cells, Tollin and Yin (652) systematically manipulated the cues by setting one or more cues to be constant while varying the spatial position using VAS [(p. 1544)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1544&annotation=PI7LGXEU)

###### importance of timing to the lso
- & The anatomical properties of the afferent circuit to LSO also contain features that suggest timing is important [(p. 1545)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=6DXBQ2XG)
- & the latency of the inhibition arising from stimulation of the contralateral ear was surprisingly similar to the excitation from the ipsilateral side, and this observation has been confirmed by many subsequent studies [(p. 1545)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=6R8MUAX8)
- & This suggests that the ipsilateral excitation was delayed relative to the contralateral inhibition by about 170 μs. [(p. 1545)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=KPCR3DCI)
- & Remarkably, all of the estimates of differences in the timing of input to the LSO from the two sides indicate that the contralateral inhibition arrives, on average, about 0.2 ms later than the ipsilateral excitation.

- & suggests that the role of timing in the LSO has been severely underestimated. Combining intracellular recordings with anatomical labeling, this study surprisingly found that responses of the LSO’s principal cells have MSO-like membrane properties and are dominated by onset EPSPs and spikes in response to tones to the ipsilateral ear, and onset IPSPs in response to tones to the contralateral ear. The sustained chopper response to ipsilateral tones, traditionally associated with LSO, was only observed in nonprincipal cells. Importantly, all neurons studied (principal and nonprincipal) showed sensitivity to ILD, and the steep sensitivity to ITDs of transients, as in Figure 23, was particularly prominent in LSO principal cells (179). [(p. 1545)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=HUAK9KCE)
- & It seems that, quite similar to the MSO, routine extracellular recording methods do not easily pick up action potentials of principal cells [(p. 1545)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1545&annotation=NYD9CLVG)
- & In the low-frequency limb of the LSO, the cells display properties of coincidence since they satisfy CD in a manner similar to MSO cells, but they retain the IE subtractive character of LSO cells. In other words, they compute anticoincidence: when the inputs from both sides arrive coincidently, the cell is shut off. In the high-frequency limbs of the LSO, the same processing occurs for stimuli featuring amplitude modulations or transients.

###### ild processing above the soc
- & It is likely that much of the EI sensitivity recorded in the ICC and higher centers reflects the binaural interaction set up in the LSO, but there are also data suggesting that some of the binaural interactions occur above the level of the SOC [(p. 1547)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1547&annotation=LM3AFEUD)
##### processing of spectral cues
#### integration of sound localization cues
- & While there is some dispute about whether there are intermediate cells that do not fit the Jeffress model in the MSO, there is uniform agreement in all studies that such cells are commonly found in the ICC, which receives inputs from MSO and LSO [(p. 1551)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1551&annotation=6IRT84BT)
- & The interaural phase versus frequency plots of such cells might be nonlinear or have CPs that are of intermediate type, which does not fit the Jeffress model as discussed above [(p. 1551)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1551&annotation=PCDWYWUD)
- & At high frequencies, ANFs cannot phase-lock to the fine structure but can phase-lock to the envelope of amplitudemodulated tones. [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=PTT2YINQ)
- & as is the case for pure tones, the ITD sensitivities of MSO and LSO are distinctly different due to coincident interaction in MSO and the subtractive or anticoincident mechanism in LSO [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=2LX6EHIV)
- & Evidence that the inputs to ICC ascending from the MSO, LSO, and DCN remain largely, but not completely, segregated was reported in recordings from decerebrate cats [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=UCUE63UJ)
- & The development of the virtual space technique has allowed manipulation of the three localization cues independently (139, 345, 346). Since ITDs and ILDs generally involve cells with different frequency ranges, such manipulations are of most utility when exploring the effects of ILDs and spectra. [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=4IGYQUNE)

- & In the barn owl, there appears to be a point-to-point map of ITDs in the nucleus laminaris, the avian homologue of the MSO (105), but there is only weak or contrary evidence of such a map in the MSO [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=C66R5869)

- & One problem for establishing a space map is that the ITD tuning found in the MSO and ICC is broad as mentioned above. There is evidence that the tuning improves, that is gets narrower, at higher centers from the MSO to ICC to medial geniculate and auditory cortex (164, 165). The problem with broadly tuned maps is especially acute for animals with small heads, which has led to the observation that in gerbils and guinea pigs, the ITD curves tend to peak near or outside the physiological range with the related proposal of the two-channel model discussed above [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=VEEEC9HK)
- & The poor evidence for a space map suggests that other coding strategies may be involved, such as by distributed coding across populations of neurons or by use of other response features such as spike timing [(p. 1553)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1553&annotation=YA7SGHDQ)

- & how the stimuli are delivered, the task used, how localization is measured, whether front-back confusions are resolved, the instructions to the subject, species differences (especially with regard to the ethological importance of the task), and the properties (spectra, level, and duration) of the stimuli [(p. 1554)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1554&annotation=XHBN6T3K)
- & (i) localization of broadband signals is more accurate than for tones (180, 555, 631, 650); (ii) spectral cues are essential for localization in the vertical dimension (83, 189, 232, 233, 236, 248–250, 252, 471, 650, 702); (iii) front/back confusions are common with tonal stimuli and can be decreased with increasing bandwidth and head movement (82, 244, 630, 674, 695); (iv) spatial acuity measured by minimum audible angle (MAA) varies with frequency in a manner consistent with the duplex theory (70, 431) and improves with increasing bandwidth of the signal (71); (v) localization errors at most positions are smaller in the horizontal than in the vertical dimension (66, 99, 180, 396, 470, 650, 690, 694); 6) binaural localization accuracy is higher than monaural listening (82, 83). On the other hand, there is also disagreement about certain aspects of the results: there is evidence supporting (431, 630) and denying (180, 396, 470, 650) that localization is considerably improved for sounds in front of the subject as compared to those opposite one ear. [(p. 1554)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1554&annotation=J2SN8TBK)

- £ Roberts et al. (532) observed early inhibition in response to both ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation, which is not consistent with lagging IPSPs [(p. 1539)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/R99YJ2CW?page=1539&annotation=QFD74236)
- £ The absolute delays between presentation of the acoustic stimulus and responses evoked in MSO neurons are of the order of 4 ms. There are so many intervening processes (in cochlea, synapses, and axons) where submillisecond delays are generated, that identification of the sources of internal delay tests the technical limits of the present neuroscientific armamentarium.
