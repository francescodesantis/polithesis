## Key takeaways
### intro
- there are three cues for localizing sounds: 2 for the horizontal (ITD, ILD), one for above-under (HRTFs).
- ITD range is in sub-millisecond range; ILDs are frequency dependent, high affected most and low unaffected (in near range, ILDs occur for lower as well); if wavelength is shorter than head width, significant ILDs occur.
- there are 4 factors that could influence exploitation of a cue instead of another:  
	1. middle ear systems that mostly transmit low frequency sounds -> ITDs, and opposite  
	2. big animals -> large ITDs -> possible to be registered  
	3. original tympanic ear is isolated pressure receivers -> max ITD is interaural distance; two middle-ear cavities are acoustically connected -> ITDs are magnified  
	4. acoustic communication can be evolutionary driving force or co-evolved feature (evolutionary feedback system and selection pressure)
### evolutionary 
- although two taxons use same cue (e.g. ITDs in birds and mammals), evolutionary histories and neuronal mechanisms are different origin

birds (from dinosaurs) hearing evolved to proceess low-frequency signals -> ITD detection

mammals -> history of being small -> most small mammals entirely on ILDs, and LSO is homogenous in all terrestrial mammals investigated; MSO has significant differences in shape and size, likely to be related to hearing range of the species

### ILD processing
LSO is site of binaural convergence; its bipolar neurons integrate excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs from ipsi AVCNwith inh (glycinergic) from ipsi MNTB; the operation between the two inputs gages the relative sound levels (encoded as activity levels of the two inputs) at the two ears within a specific bandwdth. sounds coming from one side generate high exc rates at ipsilateral, while opposite ear generates low inh contralateral. response functions are a sigmoid, with high sensitivity for small changes in ILD along the slope of the function

 the peak and slope positions of ILD functions are shifted by previous activity levels: representations of spatial positions are likely to change according to the current auditory context rather than being inflexibly coded
 
 the integration of exc and ing at the LSO is not averaged over a period of time, but very (how much?) temporally precise. *PROBLEM*: inhibitory input (1) comes from further away; (2) has an extra synapse (between GBC and MNTB); MNTB pathway is very speedy, and the synapse is one of the shortest measured in the CNS ->
 - &  physiological evidence shows that inhibition is capable of suppressing even the first spike of LSO responses [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=M7NVQDVD)


### ITD as derived from ILD processing
the LSO neurons are strongly modulated by microsecond changes in ITD. so the MSO is a refined MSO: has excitatory also from controlateral (for binaural excitatory coincidence detection), and has inhibitory ipsilateral. about this ipsilateral inhibition: [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=10&annotation=MTLX7MHP) ‚ÄúAlthough more research is required to thoroughly understand the ipsilateral source of inhibition (Leibold, 2010), it is becoming increasingly clear that having two sources of inhibition (instead of just the contralateral source) provides for greater flexibility in modulating the circuit‚Äù ([Grothe and Pecka, 2014, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/5439920/items/S82Q47FW))

 also,
 
 [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=12&annotation=IRIECZRF) ‚Äúsuggesting that the primary role of MSO and LSO might not be the encoding of absolute sound-source positions in space (in contrast to the avian system, which employs a labeled line code with a consequently sparse output corresponding to any one position in space), but rather of their relative locations compared to other sound-sources‚Äù
 
 there is more interesting research on the dynamics (how previous behavior influences rate)
 
 [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=15&annotation=GSDPPHMA) ‚Äúthese findings strongly suggest that the binaural system serves to encode the relative separation of concurrent or subsequent sound-sources rather than to provide an absolute representation of position in space.‚Äù
 
 [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=IJS2W82A) ‚ÄúThe primary function of these perceptual shifts seems to be the relative segregation of the adapting and subsequent sound-source, as the reported shifts in location are directed away from the adapter location, i.e., the perceived distance between the sound-sources is increased relative to the actual distance. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the presence of adapting sound-sources increases spatial resolution at the adapter positio‚Äù

> Our concepts of sound localization in the vertebrate brain are widely based on the general assumption that both the ability to detect air-borne sounds and the neuronal processing are homologous in archosaurs (present day crocodiles and birds) and mammals.Yet studies repeatedly report conÔ¨Çicting results on the neuronal circuits and mechanisms, in particular the role of inhibition, as well as the coding strategies between avian and mammalian model systems. Here we argue that mammalian and avian phylogeny of spatial hearing is characterized by a convergent evolution of hearing air-borne sounds rather than by homology. In particular, the different evolutionary origins of tympanic ears and the different availability of binaural cues in early mammals and archosaurs imposed distinct constraints on the respective binaural processing mechanisms. The role of synaptic inhibition in generating binaural spatial sensitivity in mammals is highlighted, as it reveals a unifying principle of mammalian circuit design for encoding sound position. Together, we combine evolutionary, anatomical and physiological arguments for making a clear distinction between mammalian processing mechanisms and coding strategies and those of archosaurs. We emphasize that a consideration of the convergent nature of neuronal mechanisms will signiÔ¨Åcantly increase the explanatory power of studies of spatial processing in both mammals and birds.

### üí¨ Evidence and arguments %% fold %%

- &  The role of synaptic inhibition in generating binaural spatial sensitivity in mammals is highlighted, as it reveals a unifying principle of mammalian circuit design for encoding sound position [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=LKKHDQMS)
- &  we combine evolutionary, anatomical and physiological arguments for making a clear distinction between mammalian processing mechanisms and coding strategies and those of archosaurs [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=33VWM96X)
- &  all hearing originated with the detection of aquatic particle motion or substrate sound by mechanical stimulation of vestibular (or lateral-line) hair-cells (Striedter, 1991; Fritzsch et al., 2002; Manley et al., 2004). Therefore, the hair-cell-based reception of non-air-born sound can be considered as basically homologous across all jawed vertebrates. However, the issue becomes much more complex when we consider the localization of air-borne sounds. Here the concept of general homology is of no help, simply because several prerequisites have to be taken into account [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=WFIYQK3N)
- &  efficient detection of air-borne sound requires impedance-matching devices (e.g., middle-ear bones, because jaw bones are too big to vibrate in response to air-borne sounds [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=M3SQTZ9P)
- &  Only in very small animals, e.g., some minute frogs, can bony elements that lack a tympanum be mechanically stimulated by air-borne sounds, and thereby directly activate the inner ear [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=P2WUYUN7)
- &  Consequently, tympani and specialized middle-ears evolved to detect air-borne sounds [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=Y6SSLTNY)
- &  evolution of the tympanic ear for transmission of air-borne sounds did not follow a single trajectory from a common origin, but represents a classic example of parallel evolution in response to a common selection pressure. [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=1&annotation=MCLKPZTB)
- &  Note that no common ancestor with tympanic ears had existed [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=2&annotation=WAT3GFG8)
- &  It is therefore safe to assume as a basis for this review that the mammalian tympanic ear evolved independently of those found in all other tetrapods ‚Äì most importantly in this context, the archosaurs (crocodiles, pterosaurs, dinosaurs and their descendants, birds; [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=2&annotation=F6ZS7SMB)
- &  will employ the term ‚Äúhomology‚Äù only where it is clear that the structures or functions in question (like specific groups of neurons or pathways) have a common developmental origin and served the same function in the last common ancestor. Otherwise we use the term ‚Äúanalogy.‚Äù [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=2&annotation=SAGD2Q8D)
- &  we first have to take into account what animals were like when they ‚Äúinvented‚Äù middle-ears [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=2&annotation=SB8QWAWJ)
- &  three classes of acoustic cues that animals can theoretically use [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=HZTZTGMW)
- &  First there are spectral cues that change when a sound-source moves from one position in space to another. Such changes are most prominent when a sound moves in the vertical plane and thus thought of as monaural [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=FM8VUL5K)
- &  head-related transfer functions,‚Äù HRTFs). These effects, however, are not fixed but depend on the direction from which the incoming sounds impinge on the pinna and ear canal. Moreover, the shape and size of the head, and even body posture, can modulate such effect [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=4K3EL4SV)
- &  such [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=FVETDCML)
- &  because of the nature of their skulls, such signals are unlikely to play a prominent role in reptile and bird sound localization. Furthermore, spectral cues are particularly pronounced at higher frequencies, which most reptiles and birds cannot hear [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=D7WN9QDN)
- &  The most important cues for localizing sounds in the horizontal plane are the two binaural cues, interaural time and level differences (Rayleigh, 1907) which depend on frequency and head features [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=QHLPEC66)
- &  Since in most animals the maximal durations of ITDs are far down in the submillisecond range (compare this to the average duration of action potentials of about 1 ms), ITD processing requires either dedicated anatomical specializations ‚Äì including acoustic/mechanical interferences [as in some insects (Michelsen, 1994) but also in frogs and to some degree in sauropsids (Christensen-Dalsgaard, 2011)]‚Äì and/or very specific neuronal adaptations at the level of nerve-cell membranes, synapses, axons, and entire circuits [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=NFF3DSXP)
- &  ILDs are frequency dependent, with high frequencies being affected most and low frequencies being almost unaffected (Rayleigh, 1907) ‚Äì at least for sounds in the far field (note that in the near range, ILDs can occur even for lower frequencies; [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=QYKC9W7E)
- &  if the wavelength is shorter than the head width, significant ILDs will occur [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=6KVXJMVJ)
- &  ILDs for a particular sound-source position increase with increasing frequencies [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=C8UYPB74)
- &  While ITDs are minute even for the most lateralized sound-source positions (¬±50 Œºs), sizable ILDs are generated by the relatively small head already at moderately high frequencies (35 kHz for this example). [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=V2G9E48C)
- &  which cue an animal uses depends on its head size as well as its hearing range. Given that features of the head differed among the early tetrapods that developed tympanic ears (see below), it would not be surprising if different structural and circuit adaptations were to develop in different lineages [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=3&annotation=F5JQ7ZAH)
- &  the mammalian middle-ear evolved right from the start as a very small, low-mass, three-boned structure that favored higher frequency sound conduction. This has significant consequences for their original hearing range and, hence, for the ‚Äústarting point‚Äù at which the evolution of their detection systems for air-borne sounds began [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=AJNRPJFL)
- &  We now consider the different combinations of anatomical factors that would be expected to favor the exploitation of a specific spatial cue [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=NKV2M37J)
- &  Middle-ear systems that preferentially transmit low-frequency sounds would suggest high selection pressures for ITDs, simply because ILDs are not relevant in that context. In contrast, middle-ears that can transmit high frequencies would favor ILD processing systems [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=AKJP3A99)
- &  Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that animals developed ITD coding only if ILDs were not significant and if the dimensions of their skulls allowed for ITDs that were long enough to be registered by some neurons in the early auditory pathways (>several 100s of Œºs) [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=ZCAGW4D8)
- &  acoustic communication, either as evolutionary driving force or simply as a co-evolved feature, may have been relevant [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=62K68F3X)
- &  physical configurations (head size and hearing range) during the time of the middle-ear development determine the cue that can most easily be exploited for sound localization for a given taxon. The binaural cue in turn shapes the emergence of distinct neuronal mechanisms that are optimized for the processing and encoding of the particular cue. Subsequent evolutionary changes in physical configurations (i.e., changes in head size and/or hearing range) might force the use of additional cues. However, the neuronal mechanisms and coding principles that will be employed to process the additional binaural cue is determined by the original mechanisms/principles that are already in place. [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=UGAS2PL3)
- &  Thus, while the same binaural cues (e.g., ITD) are used for sound localization by birds and mammals, their evolutionary histories ‚Äì and hence neuronal mechanisms ‚Äì are of different origin. [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=4&annotation=AIH8UFHI)
- **don't know what this is, we can review if needed**:
	- &  a connection between the two middle-ear cavities via a thin tube makes their hearing system a kind of pressure-gradient receiver [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=T8D3L4ZQ)
- &  Hence, Triassic archosaurs perceived low frequencies associated with only minimal ILDs, but experienced comparatively large ITDs (up to several 100 Œºs, in some dinosaurs well above 1 ms). It is therefore not surprising that these animals developed a sophisticated neuronal ITD coding system [e.g., the nucleus laminaris, NL; [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=CJP5VJHZ)
- &  To summarize, the sound localization system in birds most likely evolved to process low-frequency signals and thus is specialized for ITD detection. [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=Y3P4KS7D)
- &  Two factors distinguish their evolution from all others. Firstly, they developed a secondary jaw joint, probably due to a change of diet to seeds, which required crush [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=L3QDGBPE)
- &  This deprived all three original jaw ossicles of their former primary function ‚Äì cutting and tearing ‚Äì and allowed them to take on a secondary function, the transmission of sounds [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=45QHHSZR)
- &  Secondly, at this point, therapsids ‚Äì the hitherto dominant group of tetrapods ‚Äì were being pushed aside by the rapidly evolving dinosaurs, and were facing extinction. The only clade that survived did so by rapidly decreasing in size, ultimately giving rise to animals smaller than laboratory mice. Interestingly, during this phase, the originally much larger middle-ear bones shrank isometrically with the rest of the skull to a size suitable for transmitting sounds [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=5&annotation=BY77UU4R)
- &  Theoretical considerations had already suggested that this ear does not efficiently transmit low frequencies, but responds well to mid-range frequencies from a few up to maximally 20 kHz (Figure 3; Rosowski and Graybeal, 1991). More recent psychoacoustic evaluations and auditory brainstem potential measurements in echidna support this assumption [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=C7VECKSV)
- &  This is also suggested by their small size and that of a potential larynx, which would have produced highfrequency sounds and is supported by the fact that most small mammals still use communications calls in a frequency range beyond that of reptilian and bird hearing (e.g., mother ‚Äì pup communication [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=PW3VLV33)
- &  The second advantage of mainly high-frequency hearing is that even the smallest mammals have always experienced significant ILDs [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=3HJAUMZX)
- &  today, most small mammals rely almost entirely on ILDs, and the neuronal structure responsible for the initial processing of ILDs, the lateral superior olive (LSO), is homogenous in all terrestrial mammals investigated [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=NK2VE75G)
- &  the ITD processing structure, the medial superior olive (MSO) exhibits significant differences in shape and size, which are likely to be related to the hearing range in the respective species (low- versus high-frequency sensitivity [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=CR7IQ67H)
- &  This suggests that the ancestral neuronal structure used to process binaural spatial information was devoted to ILD detection. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=YP5HIFLI)
- &  comparative mechanism that gages the relative sound levels at the two ears (within a particular spectral bandwidth at a given time point), which are encoded in the respective activity levels of the two LSO inputs [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=8W2XQQHX)
- &  More importantly, response rates are faithfully modulated as a function of the ILD, and most LSO neurons are completely inhibited from spiking at ILDs favoring the contralateral ear (negative ILDs). [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=RWI5LP8P)
- &  Such ILD response functions typically take the shape of a sigmoid, generating high sensitivity for small changes in ILD along the slope of the function [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=WSQZ4AEM)
- &  The LSO has no homolog in other vertebrates. In birds, ILD sensitivity is generated by convergence of contralateral excitatory and ipsilateral inhibitory inputs at the level of the lateral lemniscus [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=6&annotation=R9EELLBG)

- &  first, inhibitory and excitatory ear are reversed. Second, the ipsilateral inhibition is conveyed by the lateral lemniscus of the other hemisphere, hence by a binaural nucleus. Third, because it is conveyed via an additional synaptic station through the binaural detector of the other hemisphere, inhibition is significantly delayed relative to excitation and seems to serve a response gain modulation [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=J2679YDM)
- &  The overall size of the LSO in a particular species seems to correlate with the range of frequencies to which that species is sensitive (Moore, 2000), most probably owing to the tonotopic organization of the nucleus. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=4ISLXICW)
- &  similar coding strategies for high-frequency sound-source localization at the level of the LSO. This coding strategy can be described as a roughly hemispheric code in which individual neurons encode a range of ILDs through response-rate modulation along the slope of their ILD functions [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=BXZI9UWN)
- &  Together, these findings suggest an overrepresentation of near-midline locations, in agreement with the reported maximal psychophysical resolution of ILDs around the midline [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=TVDW799T)
- &  which suggests high plasticity of ILD coding based on recent stimulus history. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=GMI8ITYR)
- &  representations of spatial positions are likely to change according to the current auditory context rather than being inflexibly coded. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=TAYSKKWB)
- &  The integration of inhibitory and excitatory inputs by LSO cells is often informally referred to as subtraction. This overly simplistic analogy should be treated with caution [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=FPWLCDYD)
- &  Indeed, neurons involved in ILD detection, including the components of the inhibitory MNTB pathway, are among the most temporally precise in the brain. Two key demands on the system impose the need for high temporal acuity. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=SGHJK2DJ)
- &  The first is the general functional requirement for high temporal resolution in sound localization circuits [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=D6C8V4GW)
- &  These systems cannot afford to integrate over long intervals to produce an average intensity difference, because the source of this average signal might well have changed in the meantime. Moreover, in the presence of multiple, concurrently active sound-sources, short integration times are crucial for discrimination between individual sounds [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=8&annotation=YEDJRBQZ)
- &  A faithful representation of amplitude-modulated signals requires not only that both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs should reliably encode the precise time of occurrence of transient events, but also that both inputs should arrive in close coincidence at the LSO cell to allow for interaction of the two.

- &  Clearly, this poses a challenge for the inhibitory input, as it must somehow compensate for the longer axonal pathway from the contralateral AVCN, as well as for the additional synapse between GBC and MNTB, which will introduce a further delay. Indeed, a detailed anatomical examination of the MNTB pathway reveals particular specializations for high conduction velocity, as both axon diameter and myelin thickness are larger in GBCs than in SBCs (Morest, 1968; Schwartz, 1992). Moreover, synaptic delays at the calyx of Held are among to the shortest that have been measured in the CNS [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=XQCPN7W2)
- &  physiological evidence shows that inhibition is capable of suppressing even the first spike of LSO responses [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=M7NVQDVD)
- &  Coincidentally, the ‚Äúsubtraction‚Äù mechanism embodied in the LSO, which had developed for ILD detection, is already equipped (pre-adapted) for ITD detection. [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=PPZQT8WG)
- &  response rates of low-frequency LSO neurons are strongly modulated by microsecond changes in ITD. These data therefore clearly establish that the temporal fidelity of the glycinergic MNTB input is sufficient to generate ITD sensitivity in LSO neurons tuned to low frequencies by modulating the excitatory inputs excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in response to fast transients. [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=6NGE8L8U)
- &  Interestingly, mammals with good low-frequency hearing typically possess both a large lowfrequency limb of the LSO and a well-developed MSO (Grothe, 2000; Grothe et al., 2010). Potentially their combined output is beneficial to the reliable encoding of sound-source positions, because the spatial tuning functions in the two nuclei are mirror images of each other: a purely suppressive coincidence mechanism (i.e., spiking occurs unless binaural coincidence exists) in the LSO is converted into an essentially excitatory coincidence mechanism for the MSO (spiking occurs only if binaural coincidence exists). [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=ZXZZSZQG)
- &  pecifically, it was suggested that contralateral inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) might arrive at the MSO cell soma slightly in advance of the contralateral EPSPs (Figure 5). This would result in a delay of the net excitatory potential, and thus explain the clustering of contralateral best delays in MSO neurons, which has been observed experimentally and across species [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=5U298Z2A)
- &  Thus, it seems plausible that contralateral inhibition should actually be slightly faster than contralateral excitation, and both older and recent work with acute brain slice preparations has confirmed that IPSPs can precede EPSPs at MSO cell somata after contralateral AVCN stimulation [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=9&annotation=GNZA4FHD)

- &  the ability of the ipsilateral source of inhibition to modulate coincidence detection in the MSO, and found that it had a marked capacity to modulate the timing of binaural coincidence [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=10&annotation=HZAAGEKE)
- &  Although more research is required to thoroughly understand the ipsilateral source of inhibition (Leibold, 2010), it is becoming increasingly clear that having two sources of inhibition (instead of just the contralateral source) provides for greater flexibility in modulating the circuit [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=10&annotation=MTLX7MHP)
- **there's a misprint, right? it should be "compared to the ILD-sensitive archetype"**:
	- &  Thus, while inhibition in the MSO circuit remains a topic of debate, it is reasonable to assume that it serves a central function in the circuit: compared to the ITD-sensitive archetype (i.e., the LSO), an additional (ipsilateral) inhibitory input has evolved in the MSO circuit [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=10&annotation=3BQGBA6Z)
- &  Hence, both in the mammalian and avian ITD system, inhibition serves a prominent function toward refining the ITD sensitivity of the detector neurons [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=10&annotation=PU2RVCJ9)
- &  the peak positions of ITD tuning functions have been found to depend on stimulation frequency in many species, irrespective of the head sizes of the species studied [(p. 12)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=12&annotation=V3FMUJT3)
- **????**:
	- &  neuronal microsecond ITD sensitivity (not spatial acuity in degree, which is a function of interaural size) is also similar across species [(p. 12)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=12&annotation=DV8ZI2SC)

- &  suggesting that the primary role of MSO and LSO might not be the encoding of absolute sound-source positions in space (in contrast to the avian system, which employs a labeled line code with a consequently sparse output corresponding to any one position in space), but rather of their relative locations compared to other sound-sources [(p. 12)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=12&annotation=IRIECZRF)

- &  In each case, GABAB receptor signaling [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=TDYR4A2Z)
- &  In the LSO, GABA is released in activity-dependent manner directly from principal LSO neurons and differentially activates GABAB receptors that are located on its presynaptic inputs [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=7J9XWN74)
- **so the LSO inhibits itself? or the specific cells?**:
	- &  Thus, the strength of inputs to a given LSO cell is controlled by its own spiking activity. In contrast, MSO cells are not themselves GABAergic [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=Q5M4NWCW)
- &  Instead, a di-synaptic feedback-loop exists, in which MSO neurons innervate GABAergic neurons in a nearby nucleus that subsequently feed back onto the MSO [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=6QYDC3DL)
- &  one-to-one cell connectivity seems improbable (GABA is most probably released via volume transmission) [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=3WUUMD5G)
- **"the tuning to the respective parameter" what does this mean?**:
	- &  the activitydependent rate adaptations in ILD and ITD coding will ultimately lead to a change in the tuning to the respective parameter [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=3SSZQVJP)
- &  In the LSO, ILD functions of individual neurons will shift significantly, changing the range of ILDs to which they are sensitive. In contrast, the tuning functions of MSO neurons are not shifted at the single-cell level, as mainly the response gain is modulated [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=SVDCI9J4)
- &  Since response rates are activity dependent, a lateralized sound-source will generate unequal adaptation in the two hemispheres (with pronounced rate adaptation only in the contralateral channel). This asymmetric change in response rates will therefore shift the intersection of the two tuning channels away from the midline toward the adapting sound-sourc [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=U4F3TZ7E)
- &  were able to demonstrate a pronounced shift in the perceived location of sound-sources after prior presentation of a lateralized adapter in human listeners. Our lab has more recently demonstrated that GABAB-mediated rate adaptation in the MSO is sufficient to explain these shifts in human perception [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=F4HE5HUX)
- &  The primary function of these perceptual shifts seems to be the relative segregation of the adapting and subsequent sound-source, as the reported shifts in location are directed away from the adapter location, i.e., the perceived distance between the sound-sources is increased relative to the actual distance. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the presence of adapting sound-sources increases spatial resolution at the adapter positio [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=14&annotation=IJS2W82A)
- &  these findings strongly suggest that the binaural system serves to encode the relative separation of concurrent or subsequent sound-sources rather than to provide an absolute representation of position in space.

- &  from the beginning, mammals could make use of ample spectral information for vertical localization using HRTFs, and for lateralization using ILDs [(p. 15)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=15&annotation=PVXNIXAU)
- &  Later, those mammals that developed low-frequency hearing based their ITD processing, at least partially, on the same neuronal structures [(p. 15)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/GRA5Q3YD?page=15&annotation=FX5JGJ9W)
