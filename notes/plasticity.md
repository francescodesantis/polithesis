We have investigated this question neurophysiologically in the mammalian superior colliculus (SC), which contains topographically aligned maps of visual and auditory space. These results imply that development of the auditory map is affected by visual activity or by information about eye position and that there is definite, but limited, capacity for the auditory map to reorganize so that it remains aligned with the visual map.

Neural maps of visual and auditory space are aligned in the adult optic tectum in barn owls. The results demonstrate that visual experience during development calibrates the tectal auditory space map in a site- specific manner, dictating its topography and alignment with the visual space map.

Based on current literature, the afferents of the superior olivary complex (SOC) are described including those from the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and auditory cortex. Intrinsic SOC afferents and non-auditory afferents from the serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems are also described.

lateral (LSO) and medial (MSO) superior olivary nuclei in ferrets 2 months after unilateral cochlear ablations at 30-40 days of age, soon after hearing onset. cochlear-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the superior olivary complex (effect on ipsi LSO and both MSO)
- & “the LSO receives direct excitatory input from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus that converges with inhibitory input from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurons driven by the contralateral cochlear nucleus” in ours, LSO only receives excitatory

the neural circuits involved in spatial hearing are shaped by experience during development and retain some capacity for plasticity in later life;
"Moreover, this behavioral compensation is mirrored by adjustments to the midbrain auditory space maps found in these species [13, 14]"

unexpected structural specializations in the Ranvier nodes and internodes of auditory brainstem axons involved in sound localization. Myelination properties deviated significantly from the traditionally assumed structure. Axons responding best to low-frequency sounds had a larger diameter than high-frequency axons but, surprisingly, shorter internodes. Simulations predicted that this geometry helps to adjust the conduction velocity and timing of action potentials within the circuit.
“Our simulations predict that this difference in structure results in GBClat axons conducting APs 33% faster than GBCmed axons (Fig. 5a), which may serve to compensate for the longer path length of GBClat axons and allow simultaneous arrival at the MNTB of afferent signals tuned to different sound frequencies.”

Neuromodulators can alter the response properties of sensory neurons, including those in the auditory system. Dopamine, which plays a major role in reward and movement, has been shown to alter neural responses in the auditory brainstem and midbrain. Recently we identified the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (SPF), part of the A11 dopaminergic cell group, as the source of dopamine to the inferior colliculus (IC). These results suggest dopaminergic innervation, likely released in a context dependent manner, occurs at multiple levels of the auditory pathway.

Neurons that process sensory information exhibit bursts of electrical activity during development, providing early training to circuits that will later encode similar features of the external world. In the mammalian auditory system, this intrinsically generated activity emerges from the cochlea prior to hearing onset, but its role in maturation of auditory circuitry remains poorly understood. We show that selective suppression of cochlear supporting cell spontaneous activity disrupts patterned burst firing of central auditory neurons without affecting cell survival or acoustic thresholds. However, neurons in the inferior colliculus of these mice exhibit enhanced acoustic sensitivity and broader frequency tuning

Adaptation is an essential feature of auditory neurons, which reduces their responses to unchanging and recurring sounds and allows their response properties to be matched to the constantly changing statistics of sounds that reach the ears. As a consequence, processing in the auditory system highlights novel or unpredictable sounds and produces an efficient representation of the vast range of sounds that animals can perceive by continually adjusting the sensitivity and, to a lesser extent, the tuning properties of neurons to the most commonly encountered stimulus values. Together with attentional modulation, adaptation to sound statistics also helps to generate neural representations of sound that are tolerant to background noise and therefore plays a vital role in auditory scene analysis.

Adaption: forward signal
Attention: feedback signal (probably from the cortex)
