closing in on bioplausibility of sound localization models

two main sections: cochlea and plasticity, as the two main bioplausibility objectives

- introduction: 
    - what is sound localization
    - what is a computational model
    - why a computational model
- sound localization background:
    - acoustic cues: ITD, ILD, HRTF
    - neural processing:
	    - cochlea - SOC (the pathway)
	    - SOC (binaural)
- & aim of the thesis (actually, what is it?)
- methodological pipeline:
	- desa net overview
	- changes applied:
		- LNTB - multi inh to MSO
		- iaf_cond_beta
		- cochlea in brian2hears
