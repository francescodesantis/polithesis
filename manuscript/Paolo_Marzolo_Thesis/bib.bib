	abstract = {In mammals with good low-frequency hearing, the medial superior olive ({MSO}) computes sound location by comparing differences in the arrival time of a sound at each ear, called interaural time disparities ({ITDs}). Low-frequency sounds are not reflected by the head, and therefore level differences and spectral cues are minimal or absent, leaving {ITDs} as the only cue for sound localization. Although mammals with high-frequency hearing and small heads (e.g., bats, mice) barely experience {ITDs}, the {MSO} is still present in these animals. Yet, aside from studies in specialized bats, in which the {MSO} appears to serve functions other than {ITD} processing, it has not been studied in small mammals that do not hear low frequencies. Here we describe neurons in the mouse brain stem that share prominent anatomical, morphological, and physiological properties with the {MSO} in species known to use {ITDs} for sound localization. However, these neurons also deviate in some important aspects from the typical {MSO}, including a less refined arrangement of cell bodies, dendrites, and synaptic inputs. In vitro, the vast majority of neurons exhibited a single, onset action potential in response to suprathreshold depolarization. This spiking pattern is typical of {MSO} neurons in other species and is generated from a complement of K

              H
              currents. In vivo, mouse {MSO} neurons show bilateral excitatory and inhibitory tuning as well as an improvement in temporal acuity of spiking during bilateral acoustic stimulation. The combination of classical {MSO} features like those observed in gerbils with more unique features similar to those observed in bats and opossums make the mouse {MSO} an interesting model for exploiting genetic tools to test hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms and evolution of {ITD} processing.},

The perceived position of the source was indicated by pointing a special gun. Depression of the trigger activated a photographic system which recorded two views of the subject, the sound source, and the gun. The absolute and algebraic, azimuth and elevation errors were measured for all subjects at each position of the source. The variability of azimuth and elevation error was also computed. In a second experiment, four of the same subjects performed the same task but in this case visually located the sources. This experiment provided an estimate of inherent motor error in the pointing task. No differences in localisation acuity between sides were found, but there were significant differences between front and back regions. Azimuth and elevation error were well matched and low in the front. However, azimuth error increased in the regions behind the head, particularly for azimuth positions 120° to 160°. Larger increases were found for positions in the upper elevations of this region. Elevation error also increased in the upper elevations behind the head. A comparison of the auditory and visual data indicates that this pattern of error is not due to motor factors. The results are discussed in relation to the structural characteristics of the pinnae and modifications that they impose on incoming sound energy.},

This model is used to simulate the pressures generated at the ears of a listener due to real sources and due to a two-channel and a four-channel virtual source imaging system. Results are presented in each case for the variation of {ITD} with head rotation. The simulations predict that the rate of change of the {ITD} with head rotation produced by a real source and replicated by the four-channel virtual source imaging system, cannot be replicated by the two-channel system. These changes to the {ITD} provide cues which allow resolution of front-back confusion. The results of subjective experiments are also presented for the three cases modeled.

To investigate this organization, we used tetrodes to record from neighboring neurons in the {ICC} of anesthetized cats and studied the similarity and difference among the responses of these neurons to pure-tone stimuli using widely used physiological characterizations. Consistent with the tonotopic arrangement of neurons in the {ICC} and reports of a threshold map, we found a high degree of correlation in the best frequencies ({BFs}) of neighboring neurons, which were mostly {\textless}3 {kHz} in our sample, and the pure-tone thresholds among neighboring neurons. However, width of frequency tuning, shapes of the frequency response areas, and temporal discharge patterns showed little or no correlation among neighboring neurons. Because the {BF} and threshold are measured at levels near the threshold and the characteristic frequency ({CF}), neighboring neurons may receive similar primary inputs tuned to their {CF}; however, at higher levels, additional inputs from other frequency channels may be recruited, introducing greater variability in the responses. There was also no correlation among neighboring neurons' sensitivity to interaural time differences ({ITD}) measured with binaural beats. However, the characteristic phases ({CPs}) of neighboring neurons revealed a significant correlation. Because the {CP} is related to the neural mechanisms generating the {ITD} sensitivity, this result is consistent with segregation of inputs to the {ICC} from the lateral and medial superior olives.},

It receives convergent input from most of the auditory nuclei in the brain stem, and in turn, projects to the auditory forebrain (Winer and Schreiner 2005). The {IC} is therefore a major site for the integration and reorganization of the different types of auditory information conveyed by largely parallel neural pathways in the brain stem, and its neural response properties are accordingly very diverse and complex (Winer and Schreiner 2005). The function of the {IC} has been hard to pinpoint. The {IC} has been called the “nexus of the auditory pathway” (Aitkin 1986), a “shunting yard of acoustical information processing” (Ehret and Romand 1997), and the locus of a “transformation [that] adjusts the pace of sensory input to the pace of behavior” (Casseday and Covey 1996). The vague, if not metaphorical, nature of these descriptions partly reflects the lack of a quantitative understanding of {IC} processing such as that which has emerged from computational studies of the cochlear nucleus (Voigt, Chapter 3) and superior olivary complex (Colburn, Chapter 4).},

	abstract = {The spatial location of sounds is an important aspect of auditory perception, but the ways in which space is represented are not fully understood. No space map has been found within the primary auditory pathway. However, a space map has been found in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus ({BIN}), which provides a major auditory projection to the superior colliculus. We measured the spectral processing underlying auditory spatial tuning in the {BIN} of unanesthetized marmoset monkeys. Because neurons in the {BIN} respond poorly to tones and are broadly tuned, we used a broadband stimulus with random spectral shapes ({RSSs}) from which both spatial receptive fields and frequency sensitivity can be derived. Responses to virtual space ({VS}) stimuli, based on the animal's own ear acoustics, were compared with the predictions of a weight-function model of responses to the {RSS} stimuli. First-order (linear) weight functions had broad spectral tuning (approximately three octaves) and were excitatory in the contralateral ear, inhibitory in the ipsilateral ear, and biased toward high frequencies. Responses to interaural time differences and spectral cues were relatively weak. In cross-validation tests, the first-order {RSS} model accurately predicted the measured {VS} tuning curves in the majority of neurons, but was inaccurate in 25\% of neurons. In some cases, second-order weighting functions led to significant improvements. Finally, we found a significant correlation between the degree of binaural weight asymmetry and the best azimuth. Overall, the results suggest that linear processing of interaural level difference underlies spatial tuning in the {BIN}.},

	abstract = {Accurate sound localization is based on three acoustic cues (interaural time and intensity difference and spectral cues from directional filtering by the pinna). In natural listening conditions, every spatial position of a sound source provides a unique combination of these three cues in "natural alignment." Although neurons in the central nucleus ({ICC}) of the inferior colliculus ({IC}) are sensitive to multiple cues, they do not favor their natural spatial alignment. We tested for sensitivity to cue alignment in the nucleus of the brachium of the {IC} ({BIN}) in unanesthetized marmoset monkeys. The {BIN} receives its predominant auditory input from {ICC} and projects to the topographic auditory space map in the superior colliculus. Sound localization cues measured in each monkey were used to synthesize broadband stimuli with aligned and misaligned cues; spike responses to these stimuli were recorded in the {BIN}. We computed mutual information ({MI}) between the set of spike rates and the stimuli containing either aligned or misaligned cues. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) {BIN} neurons encode more information about auditory space when cues are aligned compared with misaligned. 2) Significantly more units prefer aligned cues in the {BIN} than in {ICC}. 3) An additive model based on summing the responses to stimuli with the localization cues varying individually accurately predicts the alignment preference with all cues varying. Overall, the results suggest that the {BIN} is the first site in the ascending mammalian auditory system that is tuned to natural combinations of sound localization cues.},

This interaural (between the ears) time difference ({ITD}) provides a major cue for determining the source location1,2. Many auditory neurons are sensitive to {ITDs}3,4, but the means by which such neurons represent {ITD} is a contentious issue. Recent studies question whether the classical general model (the Jeffress model5) applies across species6,7. Here we show that {ITD} coding strategies of different species can be explained by a unifying principle: that the {ITDs} an animal naturally encounters should be coded with maximal accuracy. Using statistical techniques and a stochastic neural model, we demonstrate that the optimal coding strategy for {ITD} depends critically on head size and sound frequency. For small head sizes and/or low-frequency sounds, the optimal coding strategy tends towards two distinct sub-populations tuned to {ITDs} outside the range created by the head. This is consistent with recent observations in small mammals6,7. For large head sizes and/or high frequencies, the optimal strategy is a homogeneous distribution of {ITD} tunings within the range created by the head. This is consistent with observations in the barn owl8,9,10. For humans, the optimal strategy to code {ITDs} from an acoustically measured distribution depends on frequency; above 400 Hz a homogeneous distribution is optimal, and below 400 Hz distinct sub-populations are optimal.},

The consequence of this relationship is that the steepest region of the function relating discharge rate to interaural time delay ({ITD}) fell close to midline for all neurons irrespective of {BF}.

	abstract = {The integration of visual and auditory spatial information is important for building an accurate perception of the external world, but the fundamental mechanisms governing such audiovisual interaction have only partially been resolved. The earliest interface between auditory and visual processing pathways is in the midbrain, where the superior ({SC}) and inferior colliculi ({IC}) are reciprocally connected in an audiovisual loop. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of audiovisual interaction in the midbrain by recording neural signals from the {SC} and {IC} simultaneously in anesthetized ferrets. Visual stimuli reliably produced band-limited phase locking of {IC} local field potentials ({LFPs}) in two distinct frequency bands: 6–10 and 15–30 Hz. These visual {LFP} responses co-localized with robust auditory responses that were characteristic of the {IC}. Imaginary coherence analysis confirmed that visual responses in the {IC} were not volume-conducted signals from the neighboring {SC}. Visual responses in the {IC} occurred later than retinally driven superficial {SC} layers and earlier than deep {SC} layers that receive indirect visual inputs, suggesting that retinal inputs do not drive visually evoked responses in the {IC}. In addition, {SC} and {IC} recording sites with overlapping visual spatial receptive fields displayed stronger functional connectivity than sites with separate receptive fields, indicating that visual spatial maps are aligned across both midbrain structures. Reciprocal coupling between the {IC} and {SC} therefore probably serves the dynamic integration of visual and auditory representations of space.},

	abstract = {Accurate sound localization is based on three acoustic cues (interaural time and intensity difference and spectral cues from directional filtering by the pinna). In natural listening conditions, every spatial position of a sound source provides a unique combination of these three cues in “natural alignment.” Although neurons in the central nucleus ({ICC}) of the inferior colliculus ({IC}) are sensitive to multiple cues, they do not favor their natural spatial alignment. We tested for sensitivity to cue alignment in the nucleus of the brachium of the {IC} ({BIN}) in unanesthetized marmoset monkeys. The {BIN} receives its predominant auditory input from {ICC} and projects to the topographic auditory space map in the superior colliculus. Sound localization cues measured in each monkey were used to synthesize broadband stimuli with aligned and misaligned cues; spike responses to these stimuli were recorded in the {BIN}. We computed mutual information ({MI}) between the set of spike rates and the stimuli containing either aligned or misaligned cues. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) {BIN} neurons encode more information about auditory space when cues are aligned compared with misaligned. 2) Significantly more units prefer aligned cues in the {BIN} than in {ICC}. 3) An additive model based on summing the responses to stimuli with the localization cues varying individually accurately predicts the alignment preference with all cues varying. Overall, the results suggest that the {BIN} is the first site in the ascending mammalian auditory system that is tuned to natural combinations of sound localization cues.},

In this study, we utilized in vivo calcium imaging to assess auditory-evoked activities in multiple cells in layer 1 of {DCIC} and to characterize sound stimuli producing strong activity. Most cells examined showed strong responses to broad-band noise and low-frequency tone bursts of high sound intensity.

This article reviews the morphological and functional organization, as well as the role of the underlying microcircuits, of the barn owl's inferior colliculus ({IC}). We focus on the processing of frequency and interaural time ({ITD}) and level differences ({ILD}). We first summarize the morphology of the sub-nuclei belonging to the {IC} and their differentiation by antero- and retrograde labeling and by staining with various antibodies. We then focus on the response properties of neurons in the three major sub-nuclei of {IC} [core of the central nucleus of the {IC} ({ICCc}), lateral shell of the central nucleus of the {IC} ({ICCls}), and the external nucleus of the {IC} ({ICX})]. {ICCc} projects to {ICCls}, which in turn sends its information to {ICX}. The responses of neurons in {ICCc} are sensitive to changes in {ITD} but not to changes in {ILD}. The distribution of {ITD} sensitivity with frequency in {ICCc} can only partly be explained by optimal coding. We continue with the tuning properties of {ICCls} neurons, the first station in the midbrain where the {ITD} and {ILD} pathways merge after they have split at the level of the cochlear nucleus. The {ICCc} and {ICCls} share similar {ITD} and frequency tuning. By contrast, {ICCls} shows sigmoidal {ILD} tuning which is absent in {ICCc}. Both {ICCc} and {ICCls} project to the forebrain, and {ICCls} also projects to {ICX}, where space-specific neurons are found. Space-specific neurons exhibit side peak suppression in {ITD} tuning, bell-shaped {ILD} tuning, and are broadly tuned to frequency. These neurons respond only to restricted positions of auditory space and form a map of two-dimensional auditory space. Finally, we briefly review major {IC} features, including multiplication-like computations, correlates of echo suppression, plasticity, and adaptation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These spectral notches are a principal cue for the localization of sound source elevation. Physiological evidence suggests that the dorsal cochlear nucleus ({DCN}) plays a critical role in the brainstem processing of this directional feature. Type O units in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus ({ICC}) are a primary target of ascending {DCN} projections and, therefore, may represent midbrain specializations for the auditory processing of spectral cues for sound localization. Behavioral studies confirm a loss of sound orientation accuracy when {DCN} projections to the inferior colliculus are surgically lesioned. This study used simple analogs of {HRTF} notches to characterize single-unit response patterns in the {ICC} of decerebrate cats that may contribute to the directional sensitivity of the brain's spectral processing pathways. Manipulations of notch frequency and bandwidth demonstrated frequency-specific excitatory responses that have the capacity to encode {HRTF}-based cues for sound source location. These response patterns were limited to type O units in the {ICC} and have not been observed for the projection neurons of the {DCN}. The unique spectral integration properties of type O units suggest that {DCN} influences are transformed into a more selective representation of sound source location by a local convergence of wideband excitatory and frequency-tuned inhibitory inputs.},

	abstract = {1. We studied the sensitivity of cells in the medial superior olive ({MSO}) of the anesthetized cat to variations in interaural phase differences ({IPDs}) of low-frequency tones and in interaural time differences ({ITDs}) of tones and broad-band noise signals. Our sample consisted of 39 cells histologically localized to the {MSO}. 2. All but one of the cells had characteristic frequencies less than 3 {kHz}, and 79\% were sensitive to {ITDs} and {IPDs}. More than one-half (56\%) of the cells responded to monaural stimulation of either ear, and both the binaural and monaural responses were highly phase locked. All of the cells that were sensitive to {IPDs} and monaurally driven by either ear responded in accord with that predicted by the coincidence model of Jeffress, as judged by comparisons of the phases at which the monaural and binaural responses occurred. The optimal {IPDs} were tightly clustered between 0.0 and 0.2 cycles. Most cells exhibited facilitation of the response at favorable {ITDs} and inhibition at unfavorable {ITDs} compared with the monaural responses. 3. Cells in the {MSO} exhibited characteristic delay, as judged by a linear relationship between the mean interaural phase and stimulating frequency. Characteristic phases were clustered near 0 indicating the most cells responded maximally when the two input tones were in phase. With the use of the binaural beat stimulus we found no differential selectivity for either the direction or speed of interaural phase changes. 4. The cells were also sensitive to {ITDs} of broad-band noise signals. The {ITD} curve in response to broad-band noise was similar to that predicted by the composite curve, which was calculated by linearly summating the tonal responses over the frequencies in the response area of the cell. Most (93\%) of the peaks of the composite curves were between 0 and +400 microseconds, corresponding to locations in the contralateral sound field. Moreover, computer cross correlations of the monaural spike trains were similar to the {ITD} curve generated binaurally for both correlated and uncorrelated noise signals to the two ears. Thus our data suggest that the cells in the {MSO} behave much like cross-correlators. 5. By combining data from different animals and lcoating each cell on a standard {MSO}, we found evidence for a spatial map of {ITDs} across the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the {MSO}.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Disparities in time and intensity are the two chief cues animals use for localizing a sound source in space. Echolocating bats belonging to the family Molossidae emit brief, ultrasonic signals for orientation that sweep downward about an octave over the duration of the pulse. Due to acoustic shadowing and the directional properties of the ears, pronounced interaural intensity disparities are created that vary as a function of azimuth. However, due to the small headwidth of these animals, azimuthal changes create small interaural time disparities that are at most 30 μs. The experiments in this report are concerned with the binaural processing of time and intensity disparities using brief {FM} signals that simulate the animal's natural echolocation calls. Binaural neurons receiving excitation from one ear and inhibition from the other (E-I neurons) were recorded from the inferior colliculus of Mexican free-tailed bats. The majority of units sampled were highly sensitive for temporal disparities of 100–300 μs, and a few had significant changes in discharge probability when interaural time was changed by 10–20 μs. However, all E-I neurons were also sensitive to intensity disparities. With only one exception, all E-I neurons traded time for intensity. On the average, each decibel difference in intensity could be compensated for by advancing or delaying the inhibitory sound by 47 μs. The main conclusion is that the auditory system processes interaural disparities by transforming level differences at the two ears into latency differences. Thus the discharge probability of each binaural neuron is determined largely by the arrival times of the discharges from the excitatory and inhibitory ears. In view of the substantial time-intensity trading ratios, the small interaural time disparities produced by azimuthal locations off the midline play no role in shaping the response properties of these neurons. Specific examples of how time-intensity trades can translate into a high spatial selectivity are presented.},

	abstract = {The inferior colliculus ({IC}) is the first integration center of the auditory system. After the transformation of sound to neural signals in the cochlea, the signals are analyzed by brainstem auditory nuclei that, in turn, transmit this information to the {IC}. However, the neural circuitry that underlies this integration is unclear. This review consists of two parts: one is about the cell type which is likely to integrate sound information, and the other is about a technique which is useful for studying local circuitry. Large {GABAergic} ({LG}) neurons receive dense excitatory axosomatic terminals that originate from the lower brainstem auditory nuclei as well as local {IC} neurons. Dozens of axons coming from both local and lower brainstem neurons converge on a single {LG} soma. Excitatory neurons in {IC} can innervate many nearby {LG} somata in the same fibrodendritic lamina. The combination of local and ascending inputs is well suited for auditory integration. {LG} neurons are one of the main sources of inhibition in the medial geniculate body ({MGB}). {LG} neurons and the tectothalamic inhibitory system are present in a wide variety of mammalian species. This suggests that the circuitry of excitatory and inhibitory tectothalamic projections may have evolved earlier than {GABAergic} interneurons in the {MGB}, which are found in fewer species. Cellular-level functional imaging provides both morphological and functional information about local circuitry. In the last part of this review, we describe an in vivo calcium imaging study that sheds light on the functional organization of the {IC}.},

Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code.

Here we propose algorithms to simulate these models by vectorizing computation over frequency channels, which are implemented in “Brian Hears,” a library for the spiking neural network simulator package “Brian.” This approach allows us to use high-level programming languages such as Python, because with vectorized operations, the computational cost of interpretation represents a small fraction of the total cost. This makes it possible to define and simulate complex models in a simple way, while all previous implementations were model-specific. In addition, we show that these algorithms can be naturally parallelized using graphics processing units, yielding substantial speed improvements. We demonstrate these algorithms with several state-of-the-art cochlear models, and show that they compare favorably with existing, less flexible, implementations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The auditory filter system is known to be level-dependent as evidenced by psychophysical data on masking, compression, and two-tone suppression. However, there were no analysis/synthesis schemes with nonlinear filterbanks. This paper describe 18300060s such a scheme based on the compressive gammachirp ({cGC}) auditory filter. It was developed to extend the gammatone filter concept to accommodate the changes in psychophysical filter shape that are observed to occur with changes in stimulus level in simultaneous, tone-in-noise masking. In models of simultaneous noise masking, the temporal dynamics of the filtering can be ignored. Analysis/synthesis systems, however, are intended for use with speech sounds where the glottal cycle can be long with respect to auditory time constants, and so they require specification of the temporal dynamics of auditory filter. In this paper, we describe a fast-acting level control circuit for the {cGC} filter and show how psychophysical data involving two-tone suppression and compression can be used to estimate the parameter values for this dynamic version of the {cGC} filter (referred to as the "{dcGC}" filter). One important advantage of analysis/synthesis systems with a {dcGC} filterbank is that they can inherit previously refined signal processing algorithms developed with conventional short-time Fourier transforms ({STFTs}) and linear filterbanks},

	abstract = {Because the hearing impaired often experience different degrees of hearing loss along with the loss of frequencies, the loudness compensation algorithm in hearing aids decomposes the speech signal and compensates with different frequency bands based on their audiograms. However, the speech quality of the compensated signal is unsatisfactory because the traditional filterbanks fail to fully consider the characteristics of human hearing and personalized hearing loss. In this study, an effective design for the gammachirp filterbank for the loudness compensation algorithm was proposed to improve the speech quality of hearing aids. Firstly, a multichannel gammachirp filterbank was employed to decompose the signals. Then, the adjacent bands were merged into one channel, guided by the proposed combination method. After obtaining the personalized filterbank, each band conducted a loudness compensation to match the requirements of the audiograms. The excellent advantage of the gammachirp filterbank is that it can simulate the characteristics of the basilar membrane. Furthermore, the novel channel combination method considers the information from the audiograms and the relationship between frequency ranges and speech intelligibility. The experimental results showed that the proposed multichannel gammachirp filterbank achieves better speech signal decomposition and synthesis, and good performance can be gained with fewer channels. The loudness compensation algorithm based on the gammachirp filterbank effectively improves sentence intelligibility. The sentence recognition rate of the proposed method is higher than that of a system with a gammatone filterbank by approximately 13\%.},

	abstract = {In the earliest tetrapods, the fenestra vestibuli was a large hole in the braincase wall bounded by bones of different embryological origins: the otic capsule and occipital arch components, and also, in all except the Devonian Acanthostega, the dermal parasphenoid. This means that the hole lay along the line of the embryonic metotic fissure. Early tetrapod braincases were poorly ossified internally, and no specialized opening for a perilymphatic duct is evident. It is arguable that the earliest tetrapods had neither a perilympllatic duct crossing the otic capsule nor a specialized auditory receptor in a separate lagenar pouch. The primitive tetrapod condition is found in the earliest amniotes, and the separate development of (1) a fenestra vestibuli confined to the limits of the otic capsule, (2) a specialized pressure relief window also derived from components on the line of the metolic fissure, (3) a nonstructural, vibratory stapes and (4) increased internal ossification of the internal walls of the otic capsule, can be traced separately in synapsids, lepidosauromorph diapsids, archosauromorph diapsids, probably turtles, and amphibians. This suggests separate development of true tympanic ears in each of these groups. Developments indicating the existence of a true tympanic ear in amniotes are first found in animals from the Triassic period, and a correlation with the evolution of insect sound production is suggested.},

The forces depend on the presence of a motor protein in the lateral membrane of the cells. This protein, known as prestin, is a member of a transporter superfamily {SLC}26. The functional and structural properties of prestin are described in this review.

	abstract = {In models of temporal processing, time delays incurred by axonal propagation of action potentials play a prominent role. A pre-eminent model of temporal processing in audition is the binaural model of Jeffress (1948), which has dominated theories regarding our acute sensitivity to interaural time differences ({ITDs}). In Jeffress' model, a binaural cell is maximally active when the {ITD} is compensated by an internal delay, which brings the inputs from left and right ears in coincidence, and which would arise from axonal branching patterns of monaural input fibers. By arranging these patterns in systematic and opposite ways for the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs, a range of length differences, and thereby of internal delays, is created so that the {ITD} is transformed into a spatial activation pattern along the binaural nucleus. We reanalyze single, labeled, and physiologically characterized axons of spherical bushy cells of the cat anteroventral cochlear nucleus, which project to binaural coincidence detectors in the medial superior olive ({MSO}). The reconstructions largely confirm the observations of two previous reports, but several features are observed that are inconsistent with Jeffress' model. We found that ipsilateral projections can also form a caudally directed delay line pattern, which would counteract delays incurred by caudally directed contralateral projections. Comparisons of estimated axonal delays with binaural physiological data indicate that the suggestive anatomical patterns cannot account for the frequency-dependent distribution of best delays in the cat. Surprisingly, the tonotopic distribution of the afferent endings indicate that low characteristic frequencies are under-represented rather than over-represented in the {MSO}.},

The consequence of this relationship is that the steepest region of the function relating discharge rate to interaural time delay ({ITD}) fell close to midline for all neurons irrespective of {BF}.

We performed extracellular recordings in the superior olivary complex of the anesthetized gerbil and found a majority of single units localized to the {MSO} to exhibit {BDs} that shifted with tone frequency. The relation of best interaural phase difference to tone frequency revealed nonlinearities in some {MSO} units and others with linear relations with characteristic phase between 0.4 and 0.6 cycles. The latter is usually associated with the interaction of ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition, as in the lateral superior olive, yet all {MSO} units exhibited evidence of bilateral excitation. Interaural cochlear delays and phase-locked contralateral inhibition are two mechanisms of internal delay that have been suggested to create frequency-dependent delays. Best interaural phase-frequency relations were compared with a cross-correlation model of {MSO} that incorporated interaural cochlear delays and an additional frequency-independent delay component. The model with interaural cochlear delay fit phase-frequency relations exhibiting frequency-dependent delays with precision. Another model of {MSO} incorporating inhibition based on realistic biophysical parameters could not reproduce observed frequency-dependent delays.},

	abstract = {The effects of changing stimulus frequency on the interaural phase sensitivity of neurons in the inferior colliculus ({IC}) were studied in barbiturate-anesthetized cats in order to reexamine the issue of characteristic delay ({CD}). Since the results obtained with the interaural delay and binaural beat stimuli are similar, we used the averaged interaural delay curves and binaural beat period histograms as comparable expressions of a neuron's interaural phase sensitivity. When the averaged interaural delay curves at different frequencies are plotted on a common time axis, for some cells the resulting superimposed delay curves show peaks or troughs that coincide at some {CD}. For most cells, though, this method of detecting a {CD} by visual inspection yields ambiguous and uncertain results. Composite curves, computed from the average of all the normalized superimposed delay curves, are also not helpful for showing {CD}. In order to provide a more objective means of analyzing the data, we plotted the mean interaural phase versus the stimulating frequency and computed the linear regression line, using the mean square error as a measure of linearity. The slope of the regression line is the {CD} for the neuron, and the phase intercept is referred to as the characteristic phase ({CP}). Cells that display a {CD} at the peak discharge have a {CP} = 0.0 cycles, while those that show a {CD} at the minimum discharge have a {CP} = 0.5. Cells that exhibit a {CP} at any value other than 0.0, 0.5, or 1.0 will have a {CD} at some relative amplitude other than the peak or trough. For cells that exhibit a {CD} at the peak or trough, results of the analysis procedure using the phase-frequency plot correspond to those obtained from visual inspection. For cells that do not show a common peak or trough, the analysis procedure not only specifies the location of the {CD} but also provides a statistical criterion of the linearity. From this analysis about 60\% of the runs were identified as satisfying the criteria for {CD} at the P less than 0.005 level and 71\% of these {CDs} are between +/- 300 micros. Most {CD} cells do not have the {CD} at the peak or trough of the response. Our results differ from those found in previous studies but they are in essential agreement with the original concept put forth by Rose et al. (31). Some cels exhibit little change in the {CD} or {CP} with variations in intensity, while others display marked systematic shifts in both {CD} and {CP}. In general, the peaks and troughs of the composite curves show less variability with intensity than the {CD}.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {1. Encoding temporal features of the acoustic waveform is an important attribute of the auditory system. Auditory nerve ({AN}) fibers synchronize or phase-lock to low-frequency tones and transmit this temporal information to cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus ({AVCN}). Phase-locking in the {AVCN} is usually reported to be similar to or weaker than in the {AN}. We studied phase-locking in axons of the trapezoid body ({TB}), which is the output tract of the {AVCN}, and found, to our surprise, that most {TB} axons exhibited enhanced synchronization compared with {AN} fibers. 2. Responses from axons in the {TB} of the cat were obtained with horseradish peroxidase ({HRP})- or Neurobiotin-filled micropipettes or metal microelectrodes. A series of short tone bursts at increasing sound pressure level ({SPL}) was presented at the characteristic frequency ({CF}) of the fiber and phase-locking was quantified with the vector strength R at each {SPL}. For each fiber the maximum R value (Rmax) was then determined. 3. Low-frequency fibers in the {TB} showed very precise phase-locking: Rmax values could approach 0.99. For the majority of fibers (33/44, 75\%) with {CF} {\textless} 700 Hz, Rmax was {\textgreater} or = 0.9 and therefore higher than is ever observed in the {AN}. We define such fibers as "high-sync." Most of these fibers also entrained to the stimulus, i.e., they fired a precisely timed action potential to almost every stimulus cycle. Some fibers showed perfect entrainment, with maximum discharge rates equaling the stimulus frequency. 4. To exclude the possibility that stimulus paradigms or acoustic and recording equipment were the source of this enhancement, we obtained additional data on low-frequency {AN} fibers using the same experimental protocol as in our {TB} experiments. These {AN} data agree well with published reports. 5. The morphological class of some of the cells studied was identified on the basis of anatomic features revealed by intra-axonal injection of {HRP} or Neurobiotin. Labeled low-{CF} axons (N = 7), which were all high-sync, originated from {AVCN} bushy cells: five were globular and two were spherical bushy cell axons. 6. Spontaneous rate of high-sync fibers covered a range from 0 to 176 spikes/s but were biased toward low values (mean 16 spikes/s). Responses to broadband clicks and sinusoidally amplitude-modulated signals provided additional evidence of improved timing properties.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

Stimuli consisted of monaurally or binaurally presented tone bursts. The response measures obtained were effective ear, nature of effect, stimulus-frequency representation, maximum output, latency of response, and temporal pattern of tone burst-elicited discharges. Electrolytic marks were made at the unit studied or at the end of the electrode tract and in the medial superior olive. Following each experiment the locations of the units studied were determined histologically. An atlas of the laterally located {SOC} cell groups was developed to permit classification of units on the basis of localization within cell groups. Units were also classified according to the effects of stimulating the two ears. 2. All {SOC} units located lateral to the medial superior olive were excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear. Stimulation of the contralateral ear either excited, inhibited, had no effect, or had a potentiating effect on the discharges elicited by stimulating the ipsilateral ear. 3. Most lateral superior olivary ({LSO}) units were inhibited by contralateral stimulation, were narrowly tuned, produced low to high levels of maximum output, had short latencies, and produced regular discharge patterns characterized by chopper {PST} histograms with narrow initial peaks. 4. Most units within the caudal margins of the {LSO} ({pLSO}) were not affected or were inhibited by a contralateral stimulus; many were broadly tuned and exhibited intensity functions with large dynamic range and low slope. These units also had long latencies and produced chopper {PST} histograms with wide initial peaks. 5. Most units located dorsal to the {LSO} ({DPO} and {DLPO}) were not affected by the contralateral stimulus, were narrowly tuned, produced moderate levels of maximum discharge, had long latencies, and produced chopper {PST} histograms with wide initial peaks. 6.

Most units below the ventral hilum of the {LSO} ({VLPO}) were inhibited by the contralateral stimulus and many were broadly tuned {VLPO} units produced wide or poorly defined narrow-chopper discharge patterns and intensity functions with high maximum output. Most units located ventral to the lateral loop of the {LSO} ({LNTB}) were not affected by the contralateral stimulus and had response characteristics that may be related to the rostrocaudal location of the unit. 7.

	abstract = {The lateral superior olive ({LSO}) is one of the most peripheral nuclei in the auditory pathway to receive inputs from both ears, and its cells are sensitive to interaural level disparities ({ILDs}) when stimulated by sounds presented over earphones. It has, accordingly, long been hypothesized that the functional role of the {LSO} is to encode a correlate of {ILDs}, one of the acoustical cues to the spatial location of sound. In the companion paper, we used the virtual space ({VS}) technique to present over earphones stimuli containing all the acoustical cues to the location of broadband stimuli and measured the spatial receptive fields ({SRFs}) in azimuth of single {LSO} cells. The shapes of the {SRFs} were generally consistent with the {ILD} sensitivity of the cells (Tollin and Yin, 2002), but because the only variable under our control was azimuth, and not {ILD} directly, the precise cues responsible for the {SRFs} could not be unambiguously determined. Here, we test more directly the hypothesis that {ILDs} are the primary determinants of the {SRFs} in azimuth of {LSO} cells by digitally manipulating the head-related transfer functions used to create the {VS} stimuli by independently varying (or holding constant) in azimuth each of the primary localization cues in isolation while holding constant (or varying) the others. Our results support the classical view of the {LSO} that the form of the {SRFs} of the cells in azimuth is determined primarily by the {ILDs} in a small band of frequencies around the characteristic frequencies of the cells.},

	abstract = {The lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body ({LNTB}) is a prominent nucleus in the superior olivary complex in mammals including humans. Its physiology in vivo is poorly understood due to a paucity of recordings. It is thought to provide a glycinergic projection to the medial superior olive ({MSO}) with an important role in binaural processing and sound localization. We combined in vivo patch clamp recordings with labeling of individual neurons in the Mongolian gerbil. Labeling of the recorded neurons allowed us to relate physiological properties to anatomy at the light and electron microscopic level. We identified a population of quite dorsally located neurons with surprisingly large dendritic trees on which most of the synaptic input impinges. In most neurons, one or more of these dendrites run through and are then medial to the {MSO}. These neurons were often binaural and could even show sensitivity to interaural time differences ({ITDs}) of stimulus fine structure or envelope. Moreover, a subpopulation showed enhanced phase-locking to tones delivered in the tuning curve tail. We propose that these neurons constitute the gerbil main {LNTB} ({mLNTB}). In contrast, a smaller sample of neurons was identified that was located more ventrally and that we designate to be in posteroventral {LNTB} ({pvLNTB}). These cells receive large somatic excitatory terminals from globular bushy cells. We also identified previously undescribed synaptic inputs from the lateral superior olive. {pvLNTB} neurons are usually monaural, display a primary-like-with-notch response to ipsilateral short tones at {CF} and can phase-lock to low frequency tones. We conclude that {mLNTB} contains a population of neurons with extended dendritic trees where most of the synaptic input is found, that can show enhanced phase-locking and sensitivity to {ITD}. {pvLNTB} cells, presumed to provide glycinergic input to the {MSO}, get large somatic globular bushy synaptic inputs and are typically monaural with short tone responses similar to their primary input from the cochlear nucleus.},

	abstract = {1. Single-unit discharges to auditory stimuli were recorded extracellularly from superior olivary complex ({SOC}) units located lateral to the medial superior olive. Stimuli consisted of monaurally or binaurally presented tone bursts. The response measures obtained were effective ear, nature of effect, stimulus-frequency representation, maximum output, latency of response, and temporal pattern of tone burst-elicited discharges. Electrolytic marks were made at the unit studied or at the end of the electrode tract and in the medial superior olive. Following each experiment the locations of the units studied were determined histologically. An atlas of the laterally located {SOC} cell groups was developed to permit classification of units on the basis of localization within cell groups. Units were also classified according to the effects of stimulating the two ears. 2. All {SOC} units located lateral to the medial superior olive were excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear. Stimulation of the contralateral ear either excited, inhibited, had no effect, or had a potentiating effect on the discharges elicited by stimulating the ipsilateral ear. 3. Most lateral superior olivary ({LSO}) units were inhibited by contralateral stimulation, were narrowly tuned, produced low to high levels of maximum output, had short latencies, and produced regular discharge patterns characterized by chopper {PST} histograms with narrow initial peaks. 4. Most units within the caudal margins of the {LSO} ({pLSO}) were not affected or were inhibited by a contralateral stimulus; many were broadly tuned and exhibited intensity functions with large dynamic range and low slope. These units also had long latencies and produced chopper {PST} histograms with wide initial peaks. 5. Most units located dorsal to the {LSO} ({DPO} and {DLPO}) were not affected by the contralateral stimulus, were narrowly tuned, produced moderate levels of maximum discharge, had long latencies, and produced chopper {PST} histograms with wide initial peaks. 6. Units located ventral to the {LSO} appeared to have response characteristics related to unit location. Most units below the ventral hilum of the {LSO} ({VLPO}) were inhibited by the contralateral stimulus and many were broadly tuned {VLPO} units produced wide or poorly defined narrow-chopper discharge patterns and intensity functions with high maximum output. Most units located ventral to the lateral loop of the {LSO} ({LNTB}) were not affected by the contralateral stimulus and had response characteristics that may be related to the rostrocaudal location of the unit. 7. The cell groups located dorsal and ventral to the {LSO} were tonotopically organized with low-frequency-sensitive units located laterally and high-frequency-sensitive units located medially. The units located along the caudal margins of the {LSO} had a tonotopic organization similar to that of the {LSO}.},

Units were also divided according to the types of poststimulus-time histograms they produced in response to sound bursts, and they were separately divided according to the shape of their inter-spike interval histograms. These latter two groupings were highly correlated with each other and with unit class, and were combined into a single classification scheme called ‘firing-pattern type’. Units were divided into six groups based on the shapes of their tuning curves; data on the bandwidths of tuning curves are also presented. Data are presented on spontaneous firing rate, thresholds to best-frequency tones, and latency of responses to clicks. Spontaneous firing rate was found to be correlated with firing-pattern type and best frequency. We discuss the differences between our unit categories and previously reported unit categories, and the possibility that some units may be fibers. Neural mechanisms which might bring about the correlation of firing-pattern type with spontaneous rate are also discussed. Finally, we note which unit categories appear likely to correspond to neural populations which can be distinguished anatomically.},

	abstract = {Using kinetic data from three different K+ currents in acutely isolated neurons, a single electrical compartment representing the soma of a ventral cochlear nucleus ({VCN}) neuron was created. The K+ currents include a fast transient current ({IA}), a slow-inactivating low-threshold current ({ILT}), and a noninactivating high-threshold current ({IHT}). The model also includes a fast-inactivating Na+ current, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), and 1–50 auditory nerve synapses. With this model, the role {IA}, {ILT}, and {IHT} play in shaping the discharge patterns of {VCN} cells is explored. Simulation results indicate that {IHT} mainly functions to repolarize the membrane during an action potential, and {IA} functions to modulate the rate of repetitive firing. {ILT} is found to be responsible for the phasic discharge pattern observed in Type {II} cells (bushy cells). However, by adjusting the strength of {ILT}, both phasic and regular discharge patterns are observed, demonstrating that a critical level of {ILT} is necessary to produce the Type {II} response. Simulated Type {II} cells have a significantly faster membrane time constant in comparison to Type I cells (stellate cells) and are therefore better suited to preserve temporal information in their auditory nerve inputs by acting as precise coincidence detectors and having a short refractory period. Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of Ih, which changes the resting membrane potential, is a more effective means of modulating the activation level of {ILT} than simply modulating {ILT} itself. This result may explain why {ILT} and Ih are often coexpressed throughout the nervous system.},

Level-dependent gain (compression), bandwidth, and phase properties were implemented with a control path that varied the gain and bandwidth of tuning in the signal-path filter. By making the bandwidth of the control path broad with respect to the signal path, the wide frequency range of two-tone suppression was included. By making the control-path filter level dependent and tuned to a frequency slightly higher than the signal-path filter, other properties of two-tone suppression were also included. These properties included the asymmetrical growth of suppression above and below the characteristic frequency and the frequency offset of the suppression tuning curve with respect to the excitatory tuning curve. The implementation of this model represents a relatively simple phenomenological description of a single mechanism that underlies several important nonlinear response properties of {AN} fibers. The model provides a tool for studying the roles of these nonlinearities in the encoding of simple and complex sounds in the responses of populations of {AN} fibers.},

	abstract = {In neurons of the medial superior olive ({MSO}), voltage-gated ion channels control the submillisecond time resolution of binaural coincidence detection, but little is known about their interplay during trains of synaptic activity that would be experienced during auditory stimuli. Here, using modeling and patch-clamp recordings from {MSO} principal neurons in gerbil brainstem slices, we examined interactions between two major currents controlling subthreshold synaptic integration: a low-voltage-activated potassium current (I(K-{LVA})) and a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)). Both I(h) and I(K-{LVA}) contributed strongly to the resting membrane conductance and, during trains of simulated {EPSPs}, exhibited cumulative deactivation and inactivation, respectively. In current-clamp recordings, regular and irregular trains of simulated {EPSCs} increased input resistance up to 60\%, effects that accumulated and decayed (after train) over hundreds of milliseconds. Surprisingly, the mean voltage and peaks of {EPSPs} increased by only a few millivolts during trains. Using a model of an {MSO} cell, we demonstrated that the nearly uniform response during modest depolarizing stimuli relied on changes in I(h) and I(K-{LVA}), such that their sum remained nearly constant over time. Experiments and modeling showed that, for simplified binaural stimuli ({EPSC} pairs in a noisy background), spike probability gradually increased in parallel with the increasing input resistance. Nevertheless, the interplay between I(h) and I(K-{LVA}) helps to maintain a nearly uniform shape of individual synaptic responses, and we show that the time resolution of synaptic coincidence detection can be maintained during trains if {EPSC} size gradually decreases (as in synaptic depression), counteracting slow increases in excitability.},

	abstract = {1. Encoding temporal features of the acoustic waveform is an important attribute of the auditory system. Auditory nerve ({AN}) fibers synchronize or phase-lock to low-frequency tones and transmit this temporal information to cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus ({AVCN}). Phase-locking in the {AVCN} is usually reported to be similar to or weaker than in the {AN}. We studied phase-locking in axons of the trapezoid body ({TB}), which is the output tract of the {AVCN}, and found, to our surprise, that most {TB} axons exhibited enhanced synchronization compared with {AN} fibers. 2. Responses from axons in the {TB} of the cat were obtained with horseradish peroxidase ({HRP})- or Neurobiotin-filled micropipettes or metal microelectrodes. A series of short tone bursts at increasing sound pressure level ({SPL}) was presented at the characteristic frequency ({CF}) of the fiber and phase-locking was quantified with the vector strength R at each {SPL}. For each fiber the maximum R value (Rmax) was then determined. 3. Low-frequency fibers in the {TB} showed very precise phase-locking: Rmax values could approach 0.99. For the majority of fibers (33/44, 75\%) with {CF} {\textless} 700 Hz, Rmax was {\textgreater} or = 0.9 and therefore higher than is ever observed in the {AN}. We define such fibers as "high-sync." Most of these fibers also entrained to the stimulus, i.e., they fired a precisely timed action potential to almost every stimulus cycle. Some fibers showed perfect entrainment, with maximum discharge rates equaling the stimulus frequency. 4. To exclude the possibility that stimulus paradigms or acoustic and recording equipment were the source of this enhancement, we obtained additional data on low-frequency {AN} fibers using the same experimental protocol as in our {TB} experiments. These {AN} data agree well with published reports. 5. The morphological class of some of the cells studied was identified on the basis of anatomic features revealed by intra-axonal injection of {HRP} or Neurobiotin. Labeled low-{CF} axons (N = 7), which were all high-sync, originated from {AVCN} bushy cells: five were globular and two were spherical bushy cell axons. 6. Spontaneous rate of high-sync fibers covered a range from 0 to 176 spikes/s but were biased toward low values (mean 16 spikes/s). Responses to broadband clicks and sinusoidally amplitude-modulated signals provided additional evidence of improved timing properties.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

We have tested this hypothesis by studying the effect upon basilar membrane vibrations (measured by means of either the Mossbauer technique or Doppler-shift laser velocimetry) of systemic injection of furosemide, a loop diuretic that decreases transduction currents in hair cells. Furosemide reversibly altered the responses to tones and clicks of the chinchilla basilar membrane, causing response-magnitude reductions that were largest (up to 61 {dB}, averaging 25–30 {dB}) at low stimulus intensities at the characteristic frequency ({CF}) and small or nonexistent at high intensities and at frequencies far removed from {CF}. Furosemide also induced response-phase lags that were largest at low stimulus intensities (averaging 77 degrees) and were confined to frequencies close to {CF}. These results constitute the most definitive demonstration to date that mechanical responses of the basilar membrane are dependent on the normal function of the organ of Corti and strongly implicate the outer hair cells as being responsible for the high sensitivity and frequency selectivity of basilar membrane responses. A corollary of these findings is that sensorineural hearing deficits in humans due to outer hair cell loss reflect pathologically diminished vibrations of the basilar membrane.},

It arises as a consequence of damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve, and several structures are often affected simultaneously.

The prevalence increases dramatically with age. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly accomplished by measuring detection thresholds and comparing these to normative values to determine the degree of hearing loss. In addition to causing insensitivity to weak sounds, sensorineural hearing loss has a number of adverse perceptual consequences, including loudness recruitment, poor perception of pitch and auditory space, and difficulty understanding speech, particularly in the presence of background noise. The condition is usually incurable; treatment focuses on restoring the audibility of sounds made inaudible by hearing loss using either hearing aids or cochlear implants.},

This analytical approach was used to study the effects of adaptation characteristics on model parameters and of model parameters on adaptation characteristics. The results provided insights into these models and the underlying biophysical processing. This analytical method was also used to study offset adaptation, and it was found that the offset adaptation of both models was limited by the models' structures.

Temporal and average‐rate properties of {AN} responses change as a function of sound‐pressure level due to nonlinearities in the auditory periphery. The input stage of the {AN} model is a narrow‐band filter that simulates the mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane. The parameters of this filter vary continuously as a function of stimulus level via a feedback mechanism, simulating the compressive nonlinearity associated with the mechanics of the basilar membrane. A memoryless, saturating nonlinearity and two low‐pass filters simulate transduction and membrane properties of the inner hair cell ({IHC}). A diffusion model for the {IHC}‐{AN} synapse introduces adaptation. Finally, a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, modified by absolute and relative refractoriness, provides the output discharge times. Responses to several different stimuli are presented. These responses illustrate nonlinear temporal response properties that cannot be achieved with linear models for {AN} fibers.},

	abstract = {The term peripheral auditory compression refers to the fact that the whole range of audible sound pressure levels is mapped into a narrower range of auditory nerve responses. Peripheral compression is the by-product of independent compressive processes occurring at the level of the basilar membrane, the inner hair cell ({IHC}), and the auditory nerve synapse. Here, an electrical-circuit equivalent of an {IHC} is used to look into the compression contributed by the {IHC}. The model includes a mechanically driven transducer potassium (K(+)) conductance and two time- and voltage-dependent basolateral K(+) conductances: one with fast and one with slow kinetics. Special attention is paid to faithfully implement the activation kinetics of these basolateral conductances. Optimum model parameters are provided to account for previously reported in vitro observations that demonstrate the compression associated with the gating of the transducer and of the basolateral channels. Without having to readjust its parameters, the model also accounts for the in vivo nonlinear {IHC} transfer characteristics. Model simulations are then used to investigate the relative contribution of the transducer and basolateral K(+) currents to the nonlinear {IHC} input/output functions in vivo. The simulations suggest that the voltage-dependent activation of the basolateral currents compresses the {DC} potential for stereocilia displacements above approximately 5 nm. The degree of compression exceeds 2-to-1 and is similar for all stimulation frequencies. The {AC} potential is compressed in a similar way, but only for frequencies below 800 Hz. The simulations further suggest that the nonlinear gating of the transducer current is responsible for the expansive growth of the {DC} potential with increasing sound level (slope of 2 {dB}/{dB}) at low sound pressure levels.},

The approach is based on a dual-resonance nonlinear type of filter whose basic structure was modeled using animal observations. In modeling the pulsation threshold data, the main assumption is that pulsation threshold occurs when the signal and the masker produce comparable excitation, that is the same filter output, at the place of the {BM} best tuned to the signal frequency. The filter is fitted at a discrete number of best frequencies ({BFs}) for which psychophysical data are available for a single listener and for an average response of six listeners. The filterbank is then created by linear regression of the resulting parameters to intermediate {BFs}. The strengths and limitations of the resulting filterbank are discussed. Its suitability for simulating hearing-impaired cochlear responses is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A number of masking phenomena can be modeled in terms of a linear auditory filter bank followed by a temporal integrator and a simple decision device based on the signal-to-masker ratio. Other aspects require the inclusion of a nonlinearity following linear filtering. The present article concentrates on aspects of non-simultaneous, or "temporal", masking that cannot be explained by either modeling approach. A more realistic nonlinear model of cochlear processing is explored, and it is shown that most aspects of temporal masking can be accounted for with this model, in conjunction with a linear temporal integrator (temporal window) and the simple decision criterion. An earlier version of the model with a static nonlinearity following linear filtering can account for "on-frequency" nonlinearities in masking such as the growth of forward masking, the effects of forward masker duration, and the nonlinear additivity of forward and backward masking. The new model can account, in addition, for frequency-dependent nonlinearities in masking such as the upward spread of forward masking and certain aspects of two-tone suppression.},

The chapter also reviews how these characteristics, particularly cochlear-related non-linearities, determine the {AN} representation of sounds with complex spectra (e.g., speech). Finally, eight representative-phenomenological nonlinear {AN} models are reviewed and compared with regard to their ability to account for the experimental phenomena described. It is concluded that, despite the reasonable performance of some models, none of them reproduce all physiological characteristics of the {AN} response. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that different models not only use different approaches but are also validated using different criteria.

In this study, the instantaneous frequency as a function of time was measured for impulse responses of {AN} fibers in the cat with a range of {BFs} (250-4500 Hz). Impulse responses were estimated from responses to wideband noise using the reverse-correlation technique. The impulse responses had increasing frequency glides for fibers with {BFs} greater than 1500 Hz, nearly constant frequency as a function of time of {BFs} between 750 and 1500 Hz, and decreasing frequency glides for {BFs} below 750 Hz. Over the levels tested, the glides for fibers at all {BFs} were nearly independent of stimulus level, consistent with previous reports of impulse responses of the basilar membrane and {AN} fibers. Implications of the different glide directions observed for different {BFs} are discussed, specifically in relation to models for the auditory periphery as well as for the derivation of impulse responses for the human auditory periphery based on psychophysical measurements.},

	abstract = {It is now undisputed that the best frequency ({BF}) of basal basilar-membrane ({BM}) sites shifts downwards as the stimulus level increases. The direction of the shift for apical sites is, by contrast, less well established. Auditory nerve studies suggest that the {BF} shifts in opposite directions for apical and basal {BM} sites with increasing stimulus level. This study attempts to determine if this is the case in humans. Psychophysical tuning curves ({PTCs}) were measured using forward masking for probe frequencies of 125, 250, 500, and 6000Hz. The level of a masker tone required to just mask a fixed low-level probe tone was measured for different masker-probe time intervals. The duration of the intervals was adjusted as necessary to obtain {PTCs} for the widest possible range of masker levels. The {BF} was identified from function fits to the measured {PTCs} and it almost always decreased with increasing level. This result is inconsistent with most auditory-nerve observations obtained from other mammals. Several explanations are discussed, including that it may be erroneous to assume that low-frequency {PTCs} reflect the tuning of apical {BM} sites exclusively and that the inherent frequency response of the inner hair cell may account for the discrepancy.},

The model is evaluated by comparing its output with published physiological auditory nerve data in response to single and double vowels. The evaluation includes analyses of individual fibers, as well as ensemble responses over a wide range of best frequencies. In all cases the model response closely follows the patterns in the physiological data, particularly the tendency for the temporal firing pattern of each fiber to represent the frequency of a nearby formant of the speech sound. In the model this behavior is largely a consequence of filter shapes; nonlinear filtering has only a small contribution at low frequencies. The guinea pig cochlear model produces a useful simulation of the measured physiological response to simple speech sounds and is therefore suitable for use in more advanced applications including attempts to generalize these principles to the response of human auditory system, both normal and impaired.},

This model produced realistic response features to several stimuli, including pure tones, two-tone combinations, wideband noise, and clicks. Instantaneous frequency glides in the reverse-correlation (revcor) function of the model's response to broadband noise were achieved by carefully restricting the locations of the poles and zeros of the bandpass filter. The pole locations were continuously varied as a function of time by the control signal to change the gain and bandwidth of the signal path, but the instantaneous frequency profile in the revcor function was independent of sound pressure level, consistent with physiological data. In addition, this model has other important properties, such as nonlinear compression, two-tone suppression, and reasonable Q10 values for tuning curves. The incorporation of both the level-independent frequency glide and the level-dependent compressive nonlinearity into a phenomenological model for the {AN} was the primary focus of this work. The ability of this model to process arbitrary sound inputs makes it a useful tool for studying peripheral auditory processing.},

Data collected from turn 2, where best frequency ({BF}) is approximately 4000 Hz, indicate that frequency response functions are asymmetrical with steeper slopes above the best frequency of the cell. However, in turn 4, where {BF} is around 250 Hz, the opposite behavior is observed and the steepest slopes are measured below {BF}. The data imply that cochlear filters are generally asymmetrical with steeper slopes above {BF}. High-pass filtering by the middle ear serves to reduce this asymmetry in turn 3 and to reverse it in turn 4. Apical response patterns are used to assess the degree to which the middle ear transfer function, the {IHC}'s velocity dependence and the shunting effect of the helicotrema influence low-frequency hearing in guinea pigs. Implications for low-frequency hearing in man are also discussed.},

	abstract = {{HYPOTHESIS}: This study investigated whether combined technologies of finite element ({FE}) analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction of human temporal bones could be used to construct a computational model, useful in describing normal and pathologic middle ear sound conduction.
{BACKGROUND}: {FE} models for biologic systems have been used in ear biomechanics. Three-dimensional reconstructions have also been made, but not in combination with {FE} modeling and laser interferometry measuring of human temporal bones. Furthermore, an {FE} model for the human middle ear with its ossicular attachments has not been reported on the basis of temporal bone histologic sections and morphometric reconstruction, to the authors' best knowledge. Because of the size, variability, and complexity of the middle ear, accurate morphologic data and boundary conditions are necessary for accurate {FE} modeling.
{METHODS}: A fresh temporal bone was decalcified, embedded in celloidin, sectioned and stained, scanned, and digitized, and the normal middle ear was reconstructed. The histologic sections were used to construct a computer-aided design model with ligaments, muscles, and tendons as boundary conditions. The data thus obtained were converted into an {FE} mechanical model that was validated by comparison with displacements obtained by laser Doppler interferometry on 17 fresh human temporal bones.
{RESULTS}: An {FE} model was generated, demonstrating dynamic behavior that moderately approximated the laser interferometric data from human temporal bones receiving 90-{dB} sound pressure level auditory frequencies at the tympanic membrane.
{CONCLUSION}: Accurate {FE} modeling, incorporating both morphometric and interferometric performance data, predicted both normal and pathologic mechanical performance of the human ossicular chain.},

	abstract = {The primary function of the external and middle ear is to gather sound energy and conduct it to the inner ear. How this goal is achieved depends almost entirely on the passive acoustical and mechanical properties of the ear’s most peripheral structures (Fletcher 1992; Rosowski 1994). (There are active components within the middle ear, i.e., the middle-ear muscles, but these structures principally work by modulating the passive properties of the middle ear [Møller 1983; Pang and Peake 1985, 1986].) Comprehension of the function of each of the ear’s peripheral components necessitates a physical description of the relevant acoustical and mechanical properties of the components as well as quantitative schemata for how the components interact. Such schemata serve two purposes: (1) they crystallize our understanding of how the structures work and provide testable hypotheses for further refinements, and (2) they supply approximations of external- and middle-ear function which can act as prefilters in studies of the inner ear and central auditory nervous system.},

	abstract = {Head-related transfer functions ({HRTFs}) measured from human subjects were approximated using infinite-impulse-response ({IIR}) filter models. Models were restricted to rational transfer functions (plus simple delays) so that specific models are characterized by the locations of poles and zeros in the complex plane. The all-pole case (with no nontrivial zeros) is treated first using the theory of linear prediction. Then the general pole-zero model is derived using a weighted-least-squares ({WLS}) formulation of the modified least-squares problem proposed by Kalman (1958). Both estimation algorithms are based on solutions of sets of linear equations and result in efficient computational schemes to find low-order model {HRTFs}. The validity of each of these two low-order models was assessed in psychophysical experiments. Specifically, a four-interval, two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm was used to test the discriminability of virtual stimuli constructed from empirical and model {HRTFs} for corresponding locations. For these experiments, the stimuli were 80 ms, noise tokens generated from a wideband noise generator. Results show that sounds synthesized through model {HRTFs} were indistinguishable from sounds synthesized from original {HRTF} measurements for the majority of positions tested. The advantages of the techniques described here are the computational efficiencies achieved for low-order {IIR} models. Properties of the all-pole and pole-zero estimators are discussed in the context of low-order {HRTF} representations, and implications for basic and applied contexts are considered.},

In this study, {HRTFs} for sources at distances from 0.12 to 1 m were calculated using a rigid-sphere model of the head and measured using a Knowles Electronic Manikin for Acoustic Research ({KEMAR}) and an acoustic point source. Both the calculations and the measurements indicate that the interaural level difference ({ILD}) increases substantially for lateral sources as distance decreases below 1 m, even at low frequencies where the {ILD} is small for distant sources. In contrast, the interaural time delay ({ITD}) is roughly independent of distance even when the source is close. The {KEMAR} measurements indicate that the direction of the source relative to the outer ear plays an important role in determining the high-frequency response of the {HRTF} in the horizontal plane. However, the elevation-dependent characteristics of the {HRTFs} are not strongly dependent on distance, and the contribution of the pinna to the {HRTF} is independent of distance beyond a few centimeters from the ear. Overall, the results suggest that binaural cues play an important role in auditory distance perception for nearby sources.},

The anatomical and physiological bases for this “duplex theory” of localization are found in the medial ({MSO}) and lateral ({LSO}) superior olives, two of the most peripheral sites in the ascending auditory pathway receiving inputs from both ears. The {MSO} and {LSO} are believed to be responsible for the initial encoding of {ITDs} and {ILDs}, respectively. Here the author focuses on {ILDs} as a cue to location and the role of the {LSO} in encoding {ILDs}.

	abstract = {Detection of interaural time differences underlies azimuthal sound localization in the barn owl Tyto alba. Axons of the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis, and their targets in the binaural nucleus laminaris, form the circuit responsible for encoding these interaural time differences. The nucleus laminaris receives bilateral inputs from the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis such that axons from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus enter the nucleus laminaris dorsally, while contralateral axons enter from the ventral side. This interdigitating projection to the nucleus laminaris is tonotopic, and the afferents are both sharply tuned and matched in frequency to the neighboring afferents. Recordings of phase-locked spikes in the afferents show an orderly change in the arrival time of the spikes as a function of distance from the point of their entry into the nucleus laminaris. The same range of conduction time (160 mu sec) was found over the 700-mu m depth of the nucleus laminaris for all frequencies examined (4-7.5 {kHz}) and corresponds to the range of interaural time differences available to the barn owl. The estimated conduction velocity in the axons is low (3-5 m/sec) and may be regulated by short internodal distances (60 mu m) within the nucleus laminaris. Neurons of the nucleus laminaris have large somata and very short dendrites. These cells are frequency selective and phase-lock to both monaural and binaural stimuli. The arrival time of phase-locked spikes in many of these neurons differs between the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs. When this disparity is nullified by imposition of an appropriate interaural time difference, the neurons respond maximally. The number of spikes elicited in response to a favorable interaural time difference is roughly double that elicited by a monaural stimulus. Spike counts for unfavorable interaural time differences fall well below monaural response levels. These findings indicate that the magnocellular afferents work as delay lines, and the laminaris neurons work as co- incidence detectors. The orderly distribution of conduction times, the predictability of favorable interaural time differences from monaural phase responses, and the pattern of the anatomical projection from the nucleus laminaris to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus suggest that interaural time differences and their phase equivalents are mapped in each frequency band along the dorsoventral axis of the nucleus laminaris.},

	abstract = {The auditory system's ability to interpret sounds over a wide range of amplitudes rests on the nonlinear responsiveness of the ear. Whether measured by basilar-membrane vibration, nerve-fiber activity, or perceived loudness, the ear is most sensitive to small signals and grows progressively less responsive as stimulation becomes stronger. Seeking a correlate of this behavior at the level of mechanoelectrical transduction, we examined the responses of hair bundles to direct mechanical stimulation. As reported by the motion of an attached glass fiber, an active hair bundle from the bullfrog's sacculus oscillates spontaneously. Sinusoidal movement of the fiber's base by as little as ±1 nm, corresponding to the application at the bundle's top of a force of ±0.3 {pN}, causes detectable phase-locking of the bundle's oscillations to the stimulus. Although entrainment increases as the stimulus grows, the amplitude of the hair-bundle movement does not rise until phase-locking is nearly complete. A bundle is most sensitive to stimulation at its frequency of spontaneous oscillation. Far from that frequency, the sensitivity of an active hair bundle resembles that of a passive bundle. Over most of its range, an active hair bundle's response grows as the one-third power of the stimulus amplitude; the bundle's sensitivity declines accordingly in proportion to the negative two-thirds power of the excitation. This scaling behavior, also found in the response of the mammalian basilar membrane to sound, signals the operation of an amplificatory process at the brink of an oscillatory instability, a Hopf bifurcation.},

	abstract = {The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) has become a key species in investigations of the neural processing of sound localization cues in mammals. While its sound localization has been tested extensively under free-field stimulation, many neurophysiological studies use headphones to present signals with binaural localization cues. The gerbil's behavioral sensitivity to binaural cues, however, is unknown for the lack of appropriate stimulation paradigms in awake behaving gerbils. We close this gap in knowledge by mimicking a headphone stimulation; we use free-field loudspeakers and apply cross-talk cancellation techniques to present pure tones with binaural cues via “virtual headphones” to gerbils trained in a sound localization task. All gerbils were able to lateralize sounds depending on the interaural time or level difference ({ITD} and {ILD}, respectively). For {ITD} stimuli, reliable responses were seen for frequencies ≤2.9 {kHz}, the highest frequency tested with {ITD} stimuli. {ITD} sensitivity was frequency-dependent with the highest sensitivity observed at 1 {kHz}. For stimuli with {ITD} outside the gerbil's physiological range, responses were cyclic indicating the use of phase information when lateralizing narrow-band sounds. For {ILD} stimuli, reliable responses were obtained for frequencies ≥2 {kHz}. The comparison of {ITD} and {ILD} thresholds with {ITD} and {ILD} thresholds derived from gerbils’ free-field performance suggests that ongoing {ITD} information is the main cue for sound localization at frequencies {\textless}2 {kHz}. At 2 {kHz}, {ITD} and {ILD} cues are likely used in a complementary way. Verification of the use of the virtual headphones suggests that they can serve as a suitable substitute for conventional headphones particularly at frequencies ≤2 {kHz}.},

	abstract = {Detection and localization of a target sound in the presence of concurrent, spatially distributed masking sounds is one of the most challenging tasks for the mammalian auditory system. Previous studies demonstrated that the ability to localize signals is decreased by interfering noise. In order to directly compare the behavioral performance in a signal processing task in noise between gerbils and humans in the free sound field, we quantified their localization ability for a low-frequency signal in the presence of six masking noise sources surrounding the subject. Thresholds were measured both for masking noises that were correlated or uncorrelated across the masking sources. Overall, the gerbils required a higher signal/noise ratio to detect the low-frequency signal than the humans; that is, the behavioral performance of the gerbils was considerably worse than that of the humans. Moreover, switching from maskers that were uncorrelated across the masking sources to correlated maskers resulted in more masking in gerbils but in a release from masking in humans. These results would suggest that the gerbil may not be a good animal model for binaural processing. However, simulations of the localization thresholds in a numerical model of binaural processing in gerbils and humans reveal that both the inferior overall performance in gerbils and the opposite effect of masker correlation on the detection thresholds can be attributed to the smaller head size and the wider peripheral auditory filters in gerbils. Thus, the current data indicate that the binaural processor itself (i.e., the evaluation of signals coming from the two ears) is equally sensitive in gerbils and humans. However, the physical limitations imposed by the small head prevent the gerbil from performing equally well in the current paradigm.},

	abstract = {Typical development and maturation of the auditory system, at both the peripheral and central levels, is essential for the acquisition of speech, language, and auditory skills. The peripheral system generally encodes three basic parameters associated with auditory stimuli—time, frequency, and intensity. These acoustic cues are subsequently processed by the central auditory structures to reach and be perceived by the cerebral cortex. Observations of the human fetal and neonatal ear indicate that the peripheral auditory system is structurally and functionally adult-like at birth. In contrast, the central auditory system exhibits progressive anatomical and physiologic changes until early adulthood. Enriched experience with sound is fundamental and critical to auditory development. The absence of early and prolonged acoustic stimulation delays neuronal maturation, affecting the central auditory nervous system, in particular, and leading to atypical development. The present chapter reviews the various stages of development of the auditory system structures, especially the embryology of the human ear, before briefly presenting the trajectories of typical development of auditory abilities from infants to school-aged children.},

In 2 experiments 9 adults localized sounds that were synthesized so that 2 cues provided conflicting information. Exp 1 addressed localization of wideband stimuli, and Exp 2 addressed localization of high-pass-filtered stimuli. When low-frequency interaural time cues were present, they overrode the interaural intensity and spectral shape cues present in both low and high frequencies and, thus, provided a dominant cue. With wideband stimuli, interaural intensity and spectral shape cues seemed to be secondary in cueing apparent source azimuth and elevation. The interaural time cue may be used primarily to establish the locus of possible source directions. Interaural intensity and spectral cues are then analyzed to resolve confusions.

	abstract = {Very large networks of spiking neurons can be simulated efficiently in parallel under the constraint that spike times are bound to an equidistant time grid. Within this scheme, the subthreshold dynamics of a wide class of integrate-and-fire-type neuron models can be integrated exactly from one grid point to the next. However, the loss in accuracy caused by restricting spike times to the grid can have undesirable consequences, which has led to interest in interpolating spike times between the grid points to retrieve an adequate representation of network dynamics. We demonstrate that the exact integration scheme can be combined naturally with off-grid spike events found by interpolation. We show that by exploiting the existence of a minimal synaptic propagation delay, the need for a central event queue is removed, so that the precision of event-driven simulation on the level of single neurons is combined with the efficiency of time-driven global scheduling. Further, for neuron models with linear subthreshold dynamics, even local event queuing can be avoided, resulting in much greater efficiency on the single-neuron level. These ideas are exemplified by two implementations of a widely used neuron model. We present a measure for the efficiency of network simulations in terms of their integration error and show that for a wide range of input spike rates, the novel techniques we present are both more accurate and faster than standard techniques.},

Yet, latency from the thalamus to a cortical cell is remarkably constant across the cortex (typically, approximately 2 ms). Here, we found a mechanism that produces invariability of latency among thalamocortical afferents, irrespective of the variability of travelling distances. The conduction velocity ({CV}) was calculated from excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from layer {IV} cells in mouse thalamocortical slices by stimulating the ventrobasal nucleus of the thalamus ({VB}) and white matter ({WM}). In adults, the obtained {CV} for {VB} to {WM} ({CV}({VB}-{WM}); 3.28 +/- 0.11 ms) was approximately 10 times faster than that of {WM} to layer {IV} cells ({CV}({WM}-{IV}); 0.33 +/- 0.05 ms). The {CV}({VB}-{WM}) was confirmed by recording antidromic single-unit responses from {VB} cells by stimulating {WM}. Exclusion of synaptic delay from {CV}({WM}-{IV}) did not account for the 10-fold difference of {CV}. By histochemical staining, it was revealed that {VB} to {WM} was heavily myelinated, whereas in the cortex staining became substantially weaker. We also found that such morphological and physiological characteristics developed in parallel and were accomplished around postnatal week 4. Considering that {VB} to {WM} is longer and more variable in length among afferents than is the intracortical region, such an enormous difference of {CV} makes conduction time heavily dependent on the length of intracortical region, which is relatively constant. Our finding may well provide a general strategy of connecting multiple sites irrespective of distances in the brain.},

	abstract = {Myelin controls the time required for an action potential to travel from the neuronal soma to the axon terminal, defining the temporal manner in which information is processed within the {CNS}. The presence of myelin, the internodal length, and the thickness of the myelin sheath are powerful structural factors that control the velocity and fidelity of action potential transmission. Emerging evidence indicates that myelination is sensitive to environmental experience and neuronal activity. Activity-dependent modulation of myelination can dynamically alter action potential conduction properties but direct functional in vivo evidence and characterization of the underlying myelin changes is lacking. We demonstrate that in mice long-term monocular deprivation increases oligodendrogenesis in the retinogeniculate pathway but shortens myelin internode lengths without affecting other structural properties of myelinated fibers. We also demonstrate that genetically attenuating synaptic glutamate neurotransmission from retinal ganglion cells phenocopies the changes observed after monocular deprivation, suggesting that glutamate may constitute a signal for myelin length regulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that visual deprivation and shortened internodes are associated with a significant reduction in nerve conduction velocity in the optic nerve. Our results reveal the importance of sensory input in the building of myelinated fibers and suggest that this activity-dependent alteration of myelination is important for modifying the conductive properties of brain circuits in response to environmental experience.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: Oligodendrocyte precursor cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and are capable of ensheathing axons with myelin without molecular cues from neurons. However, this default myelination process can be modulated by changes in neuronal activity. Here, we show, for the first time, that experience-dependent activity modifies the length of myelin internodes along axons altering action potential conduction velocity. Such a mechanism would allow for variations in conduction velocities that provide a degree of plasticity in accordance to environmental needs. It will be important in future work to investigate how these changes in myelination and conduction velocity contribute to signal integration in postsynaptic neurons and circuit function.},

After hearing onset, the strength and subcellular location of these inhibitory inputs are dramatically altered, but the cellular processes underlying this experience-dependent refinement are unknown. Here we reveal a form of inhibitory long-term potentiation ({iLTP}) in {MSO} neurons that is dependent on spiking and synaptic activation but is not affected by their fine-scale relative timing at higher frequencies prevalent in auditory circuits. We find that {iLTP} reinforces inhibitory inputs coactive with binaural excitation in a cumulative manner, likely well suited for networks featuring persistent high frequency activity. We also show that a steep drop in action potential size and backpropagation limits induction of {iLTP} to the first two weeks of hearing. These intrinsic changes would deprive more distal inhibitory synapses of reinforcement conceivably establishing the mature, soma-biased pattern of inhibition., Winters et al demonstrate a mechanism for reinforcement of inhibitory inputs that are coactive with excitatory inputs in a brainstem circuit critical for sound localization, and that this plasticity is gated developmentally by the progressive decline of action potential backpropagation.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0940-23.2023},
	abstract = {Interaural time differences ({ITDs}) are a major cue for sound localization and change with increasing head size. Since the barn owl's head width more than doubles in the month after hatching, we hypothesized that the development of their {ITD} detection circuit might be modified by experience. To test this, we raised owls with unilateral ear inserts that delayed and attenuated the acoustic signal, and then measured the {ITD} representation in the brainstem nucleus laminaris ({NL}) when they were adults. The {ITD} circuit is composed of delay line inputs to coincidence detectors, and we predicted that plastic changes would lead to shorter delays in the axons from the manipulated ear, and complementary shifts in {ITD} representation on the two sides. In owls that received ear inserts starting around P14, the maps of {ITD} shifted in the predicted direction, but only on the ipsilateral side, and only in those tonotopic regions that had not experienced auditory stimulation prior to insertion. The contralateral map did not change. Thus, experience-dependent plasticity of the {ITD} circuit occurs in {NL}, and our data suggest that ipsilateral and contralateral delays are independently regulated. As a result, altered auditory input during development leads to long-lasting changes in the representation of {ITD}.Significance Statement The early life of barn owls is marked by increasing sensitivity to sound, and by increasing {ITDs}. Their prolonged post-hatch development allowed us to examine the role of altered auditory experience in the development of {ITD} detection circuits. We raised owls with a unilateral ear insert and found that their maps of {ITD} were altered by experience, but only in those tonotopic regions ipsilateral to the occluded ear that had not experienced auditory stimulation prior to insertion. This experience-induced plasticity allows the sound localization circuits to be customized to individual characteristics, such as the size of the head, and potentially to compensate for imbalanced hearing sensitivities between the left and right ears.},

	abstract = {Reliable synaptic transmission is essential for interneuronal communication. Synaptic inputs to auditory brainstem neurons, particularly those involved in sound localization, are characterized by resilience during sustained activity and temporal precision in the sub-millisecond range. Both features are obtained by synchronous release of a high number of synaptic vesicles following a single action potential. Here, we compare transmission behavior of three heterogeneous types of inputs in the auditory midbrain and medulla. The first terminate in the central inferior colliculus ({ICc}) and are glutamatergic (activated from the lateral lemniscus, {LL}). The medullary inputs terminate in the lateral superior olive ({LSO}) and are glutamatergic (from the cochlear nuclear complex, {CN}) or glycinergic (from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, {MNTB}). {LSO} neurons are the first to integrate binaural information and compute interaural level differences, whereas {ICc} neurons receive information from almost all auditory brainstem nuclei and construct an initial auditory image used for reflexive behavior. We hypothesized that {CN}-{LSO} and {MNTB}-{LSO} inputs are more resilient to synaptic fatigue during sustained stimulation than {LL}-{ICc} inputs. To test the hypothesis, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute brainstem slices of juvenile mice. We investigated the synaptic performance during prolonged periods of high-frequency stimulation (60 s, up to 200 Hz) and assessed several features, e.g. depression, recovery, latency, temporal precision, quantal size and content, readily releasable pool size, release probability, and replenishment rate. Overall, {LL}-{ICc} inputs performed less robustly and temporally precisely than {CN}-{LSO} and {MNTB}-{LSO} inputs. When stimulated at ≥50 Hz, the former depressed completely within a few seconds. In contrast, {CN}-{LSO} and {MNTB}-{LSO} inputs transmitted faithfully up to 200 Hz, indicative of very efficient replenishment mechanisms. {LSO} inputs also displayed considerably lower latency jitter than {LL}-{ICc} inputs. The latter behaved similarly to two types of input in the hippocampus for which we performed a meta-analysis. Mechanistically, the high-fidelity behavior of {LSO} inputs, particularly {MNTB}-{LSO} synapses, is based on exceptional release properties not present at auditory midbrain or hippocampal inputs. We conclude that robustness and temporal precision are hallmarks of auditory synapses in the medullary brainstem. These key features are less eminent at higher stations, such as the {ICc}, and they are also absent outside the central auditory system, namely the hippocampal formation.},

In the unmyelinated axons of hippocampus, the conduction speed of {APs} depends crucially on axon diameters, which vary widely. However, it is not known whether axon diameters are dynamic and regulated by activity-dependent mechanisms. Using time-lapse superresolution microscopy in brain slices, we report that axons grow wider after high-frequency {AP} firing: synaptic boutons undergo a rapid enlargement, which is mostly transient, whereas axon shafts show a more delayed and progressive increase in diameter. Simulations of {AP} propagation incorporating these morphological dynamics predicted bidirectional effects on {AP} conduction speed. The predictions were confirmed by electrophysiological experiments, revealing a phase of slowed down {AP} conduction, which is linked to the transient enlargement of the synaptic boutons, followed by a sustained increase in conduction speed that accompanies the axon shaft widening induced by high-frequency {AP} firing. Taken together, our study outlines a morphological plasticity mechanism for dynamically fine-tuning {AP} conduction velocity, which potentially has wide implications for the temporal transfer of information in the brain.},

	abstract = {Accurate auditory localization relies on neural computations based on spatial cues present in the sound waves at each ear. The values of these cues depend on the size, shape, and separation of the two ears and can therefore vary from one individual to another. As with other perceptual skills, the neural circuits involved in spatial hearing are shaped by experience during development and retain some capacity for plasticity in later life. However, the factors that enable and promote plasticity of auditory localization in the adult brain are unknown. Here we show that mature ferrets can rapidly relearn to localize sounds after having their spatial cues altered by reversibly occluding one ear, but only if they are trained to use these cues in a behaviorally relevant task, with greater and more rapid improvement occurring with more frequent training. We also found that auditory adaptation is possible in the absence of vision or error feedback. Finally, we show that this process involves a shift in sensitivity away from the abnormal auditory spatial cues to other cues that are less affected by the earplug. The mature auditory system is therefore capable of adapting to abnormal spatial information by reweighting different localization cues. These results suggest that training should facilitate acclimatization to hearing aids in the hearing impaired., After training on a behaviorally relevant task, adult ferrets rapidly adapt to altered auditory localization cues by reweighing the less distorted spectral cues of the stimulus.},

In the mammalian auditory system, this intrinsically generated activity emerges from the cochlea prior to hearing onset, but its role in maturation of auditory circuitry remains poorly understood. We show that selective suppression of cochlear supporting cell spontaneous activity disrupts patterned burst firing of central auditory neurons without affecting cell survival or acoustic thresholds. However, neurons in the inferior colliculus of these mice exhibit enhanced acoustic sensitivity and broader frequency tuning, resulting in wider isofrequency laminae. Despite this enhanced neural responsiveness, total tone-responsive regions in the auditory cortex are substantially smaller. Thus, disruption of pre-hearing cochlear activity causes profound changes in neural encoding of sound, with important implications for restoration of hearing in individuals who experience reduced activity during this critical developmental period.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulators can alter the response properties of sensory neurons, including those in the auditory system. Dopamine, which plays a major role in reward and movement, has been shown to alter neural responses in the auditory brainstem and midbrain. Recently we identified the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus ({SPF}), part of the A11 dopaminergic cell group, as the source of dopamine to the inferior colliculus ({IC}). The superior olivary complex ({SOC}) is also a likely target of dopaminergic projections from the {SPF} because it receives projections from the {SPF} and contains fibers and terminals immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. However, it is unknown if the projections from the {SPF} to {SOC} are dopaminergic, and if single neurons in the {SPF} project to both the {IC} and {SOC}. Using anterograde tracing combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we found that the {SPF} sends dopaminergic projections to the superior paraolivary nucleus and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, but not the lateral superior olive. We confirmed these projections using a retrograde tracer. By making dual retrograde deposits in the {IC} and {SOC}, we found that individual dopaminergic cells innervate both the {IC} and {SOC}. These results suggest dopaminergic innervation, likely released in a context dependent manner, occurs at multiple levels of the auditory pathway.},

Here we report unexpected structural specializations in the Ranvier nodes and internodes of auditory brainstem axons involved in sound localization. Myelination properties deviated significantly from the traditionally assumed structure. Axons responding best to low-frequency sounds had a larger diameter than high-frequency axons but, surprisingly, shorter internodes. Simulations predicted that this geometry helps to adjust the conduction velocity and timing of action potentials within the circuit. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo confirmed higher conduction velocities in low-frequency axons. Moreover, internode length decreased and Ranvier node diameter increased progressively along the distal axon segments, which simulations show was essential to ensure precisely timed depolarization of the giant calyx of Held presynaptic terminal. Thus, individual anatomical parameters of myelinated axons can be tuned to optimize pathways involved in temporal processing.,

These two nuclei are the first significant sites of binaural convergence in the ascending auditory system, and both receive direct projections from the deafferented cochlear nucleus. Cochlear ablation results in a decrease in the overall level of calretinin immunostaining within the {LSO} ipsilaterally compared with the contralateral side and with control animals and within the {MSO} bilaterally compared with control ferrets. In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the {LSO} was significantly less in cochlear ablated than control animals. In contrast, there was no effect of cochlear ablation on the level of calretinin immunostaining within neurons either in the contralateral {LSO} or in the {MSO}. These results are consistent with a downregulation in calretinin within the neuropil of {MSO} bilaterally and {LSO} ipsilaterally, as well as a downregulation in calretinin within somata in the ipsilateral {LSO} as a result of unilateral cochlear ablation soon after hearing onset. Thus, cochlear-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the superior olivary complex. J. Comp.

	abstract = {, Adaptation is an essential feature of auditory neurons, which reduces their responses to unchanging and recurring sounds and allows their response properties to be matched to the constantly changing statistics of sounds that reach the ears. As a consequence, processing in the auditory system highlights novel or unpredictable sounds and produces an efficient representation of the vast range of sounds that animals can perceive by continually adjusting the sensitivity and, to a lesser extent, the tuning properties of neurons to the most commonly encountered stimulus values. Together with attentional modulation, adaptation to sound statistics also helps to generate neural representations of sound that are tolerant to background noise and therefore plays a vital role in auditory scene analysis. In this review, we consider the diverse forms of adaptation that are found in the auditory system in terms of the processing levels at which they arise, the underlying neural mechanisms, and their impact on neural coding and perception. We also ask what the dynamics of adaptation, which can occur over multiple timescales, reveal about the statistical properties of the environment. Finally, we examine how adaptation to sound statistics is influenced by learning and experience and changes as a result of aging and hearing loss.},

Auditory temporal resolution for certain processes can be a hundredth of the period of the signal, and can extend down to the microseconds time scale. The astonishingly large number of variations that correspond to the neural excitation pattern of 30,000 auditory nerve fibers, originating from 3500 inner hair cells, explicates the vast capacity of the auditory system for the resolution of sonic detail.

The main parts of the models concern mechanical filtering effects and the mapping of mechanical vibrations into neural representation. Our model cleanly separates these effects into time-invariant linear filtering based on a simple cascade/parallel filterbank network of second-order sections, plus transduction and compression based on half-wave rectification with a nonlinear coupled automatic gain control network. Compared to other speech analysis techniques, this model does a much better job of preserving important detail in both time and frequency, which is important for robust sound analysis.

Principal neurons of the medial superior olive ({MSO}) are sensitive to {ITD}, and each {MSO} neuron responds optimally to a best {ITD} ({bITD}). In many cells, especially those tuned to low sound frequencies, these {bITDs} correspond to {ITDs} for which the contralateral ear leads, and are often larger than the ecologically relevant range, defined by the ratio of the interaural distance and the speed of sound. Using in vivo recordings in gerbils, we found that shortly after hearing onset the {bITDs} were even more contralaterally leading than found in adult gerbils, and travel latencies for contralateral sound-evoked activity clearly exceeded those for ipsilateral sounds. During the following weeks, both these latencies and their interaural difference decreased. A computational model indicated that spike timing-dependent plasticity can underlie this fine-tuning. Our results suggest that {MSO} neurons start out with a strong predisposition toward contralateral sounds due to their longer neural travel latencies, but that, especially in high-frequency neurons, this predisposition is subsequently mitigated by differential developmental fine-tuning of the travel latencies.},

Each {MSO} neuron has its own ‘‘best {ITD}’’ to which it responds optimally. A difference in physical path length of the excitatory inputs from both ears cannot fully account for the {ITD} tuning of {MSO} neurons. As a result, it is still debated how these inputs interact and whether the segregation of inputs to opposite dendrites, well-timed synaptic inhibition, or asymmetries in synaptic potentials or cellular morphology further optimize coincidence detection or {ITD} tuning. Using in vivo whole-cell and juxtacellular recordings, we show here that {ITD} tuning of {MSO} neurons is determined by the timing of their excitatory inputs. The inputs from both ears sum linearly, whereas spike probability depends nonlinearly on the size of synaptic inputs. This simple coincidence detection scheme thus makes accurate sound localization possible.},

Here, we show in gerbil {MSO} principal cells in vitro that feedforward inhibition precedes direct excitation, providing a concurrent hyperpolarization and conductance shunt during {EPSP} summation. We show with dual patch recordings and dynamic clamp that both the linearity and temporal fidelity of synaptic integration is improved by reducing Kv1 potassium channel conductance during inhibition, which counters membrane shunting even at high frequencies where {IPSPs} sum. The reduction of peak excitation by preceding inhibition lowers spike probability, narrowing but not shifting the window for detecting binaural coincidence. The interplay between inhibition and potassium conductances thus improves the consistency and resolution of {ITD} coding across different frequencies.},

Here we determine the impact of inhibition on coincidence detection in adult Mongolian gerbil {MSO} brain slices by testing precise temporal integration of measured synaptic responses using conductance-clamp. We find that inhibition dynamically shifts the peak timing of excitation, depending on its relative arrival time, which in turn modulates the timing of best coincidence detection. Inhibitory control of coincidence detection timing is consistent with the diversity of {ITD} functions observed in vivo and is robust under physiologically relevant conditions.

One important cue for localization of low-frequency sound sources in the horizontal plane are inter-aural time differences ({ITDs}) which are first analyzed in the medial superior olive ({MSO}) in the brainstem. Neural recordings of {ITD} tuning curves at various stages along the auditory pathway suggest that {ITDs} in the mammalian brainstem are not represented in form of a Jeffress-type place code. An alternative is the hemispheric opponent-channel code, according to which {ITDs} are encoded as the difference in the responses of the {MSO} nuclei in the two hemispheres. In this study, we present a physiologically-plausible, spiking neuron network model of the mammalian {MSO} circuit and apply two different methods of extracting {ITDs} from arbitrary sound signals. The network model is driven by a functional model of the auditory periphery and physiological models of the cochlear nucleus and the {MSO}. Using a linear opponent-channel decoder, we show that the network is able to detect changes in {ITD} with a precision down to 10 μs and that the sensitivity of the decoder depends on the slope of the {ITD}-rate functions. A second approach uses an artificial neuronal network to predict {ITDs} directly from the spiking output of the {MSO} and {ANF} model. Using this predictor, we show that the {MSO}-network is able to reliably encode static and time-dependent {ITDs} over a large frequency range, also for complex signals like speech.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We employ a single-chip prototype of the {BrainScaleS} 2 neuromorphic system to implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity in a spiking network that learns to play a simplified version of the Pong video game by smooth pursuit. This system combines an electronic mixed-signal substrate for emulating neuron and synapse dynamics with an embedded digital processor for on-chip learning, which in this work also serves to simulate the virtual environment and learning agent. The analog emulation of neuronal membrane dynamics enables a 1000-fold acceleration with respect to biological real-time, with the entire chip operating on a power budget of 57 {mW}. Compared to an equivalent simulation using state-of-the-art software, the on-chip emulation is at least one order of magnitude faster and three orders of magnitude more energy-efficient. We demonstrate how on-chip learning can mitigate the effects of fixed-pattern noise, which is unavoidable in analog substrates, while making use of temporal variability for action exploration. Learning compensates imperfections of the physical substrate, as manifested in neuronal parameter variability, by adapting synaptic weights to match respective excitability of individual neurons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we argue that mammalian and avian phylogeny of spatial hearing is characterized by a convergent evolution of hearing air-borne sounds rather than by homology. In particular, the different evolutionary origins of tympanic ears and the different availability of binaural cues in early mammals and archosaurs imposed distinct constraints on the respective binaural processing mechanisms. The role of synaptic inhibition in generating binaural spatial sensitivity in mammals is highlighted, as it reveals a unifying principle of mammalian circuit design for encoding sound position. Together, we combine evolutionary, anatomical and physiological arguments for making a clear distinction between mammalian processing mechanisms and coding strategies and those of archosaurs. We emphasize that a consideration of the convergent nature of neuronal mechanisms will signiﬁcantly increase the explanatory power of studies of spatial processing in both mammals and birds.},

The following conclusions are reached. It is possible that at no stage in mammalian phylogeny was there a middle ear similar to that of “typical” living reptiles, with a postquadrate tympanic membrane contacted by an extrastapes. The squamosal sulcus of cynodonts and other therapsids, usually thought to have housed a long external acoustic meatus, possibly held a depressor mandibulae muscle. In therapsids an air-filled chamber (recessus mandibularis of Westoll) extended deep to the reflected lamina and into the depression (external fossa) on the outer aspect of the angular element. A similar chamber was present in sphenacodontids but pterygoideus musculature occupied the small external fossa. The thin tissues superficial to the recessus mandibularis served as eardrum. Primitively, vibrations reached the stapes mainly via the anterior hyoid cornu, but in dicynodonts therocephalians, and cynodonts, vibrations passed mainly or exclusively from mandible to quadrate to stapes and the reflected lamina was a component of the eardrum. In the therapsid phase of mammalian phylogeny, auditory adaptation was an important aspect of jaw evolution. Auditory efficiency, and sensitivity to higher sound frequencies, were enhanced by diminution and loosening of the postdentary elements and quadrate, along with transference of musculature from postdentary elements to the dentary. These changes were made possible by associated modifications, including posterior expansion of the dentary. Establishment of a dentray-squamosal articulation permitted continuation of these trends, leading to the definitive mammalian condition, with no major change in auditory mechanism except that in most mammals (not monotremes) the angular, as tympanic, eventually became a non-vibrating structure.},

A. (2005). “Detection of high-frequency spectral notches as a function of level,” J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 118, 2458–2469]. One possible explanation is that the notch is less clearly represented internally at 70–80dB {SPL} than at any other level. To test this hypothesis, forward-masking patterns were measured for flat-spectrum and notched noise maskers for masker levels of 50, 70, 80, and 90dB {SPL}. Masking patterns were measured in two conditions: (1) fixing the masker-probe time interval at 2ms and (2) varying the interval to achieve similar masked thresholds for different masker levels. The depth of the spectral notch remained approximately constant in the fixed-interval masking patterns and gradually decreased with increasing masker level in the variable-interval masking patterns. This difference probably reflects the effects of peripheral compression. These results are inconsistent with the nonmonotonic level-dependent performance in spectral discrimination. Assuming that a forward-masking pattern is a reasonable psychoacoustical correlate of the auditory-nerve rate-profile representation of the stimulus spectrum, these results undermine the common view that high-frequency spectral notches must be encoded in the rate-profile of auditory-nerve fibers.},

The {EPSP}-spike protocol led to {LTD} in cartwheel cells, but no synaptic changes resulted from the reverse sequence (spike-{EPSP}). Plasticity in fusiform and cartwheel cells therefore followed Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, respectively. Similarly, spikes generated by summing {EPSPs} from different groups of parallel fibers produced {LTP} in fusiform cells, and {LTD} in cartwheel cells. {LTD} could also be induced in glutamatergic inputs of cartwheel cells by pairing parallel-fiber {EPSPs} with depolarizing glycinergic {PSPs} from neighboring cartwheel cells.

Traditionally, {ITDs} are thought to be encoded by an array of coincidence-detector neurons, receiving excitatory inputs from the two ears via axons of variable length (‘delay lines’), to create a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space1,2. Compelling evidence for the existence of such a map in the mammalian {lTD} detector, the medial superior olive ({MSO}), however, is lacking. Equally puzzling is the role of a—temporally very precise3—glycine-mediated inhibitory input to {MSO} neurons. Using in vivo recordings from the {MSO} of the Mongolian gerbil, we found the responses of {ITD}-sensitive neurons to be inconsistent with the idea of a topographic map of auditory space. Moreover, local application of glycine and its antagonist strychnine by iontophoresis (through glass pipette electrodes, by means of an electric current) revealed that precisely timed glycine-controlled inhibition is a critical part of the mechanism by which the physiologically relevant range of {ITDs} is encoded in the {MSO}. A computer model, simulating the response of a coincidence-detector neuron with bilateral excitatory inputs and a temporally precise contralateral inhibitory input, supports this conclusion.},

	abstract = {We have recorded from principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body ({MNTB}) in the cat's superior olivary complex using either glass micropipettes filled with Neurobiotin or horseradish peroxidase for intracellular recording and subsequent labeling or extracellular metal microelectrodes relying on prepotentials and electrode location. Labeled principal cells had cell bodies that usually gave rise to one or two primary dendrites, which branched profusely in the vicinity of the cell. At the electron microscopic ({EM}) level, there was a dense synaptic terminal distribution on the cell body and proximal dendrites. Up to half the measured cell surface could be covered with excitatory terminals, whereas inhibitory terminals consistently covered about one-fifth. The distal dendrites were very sparsely innervated. The thick myelinated axon originated from the cell body and innervated nuclei exclusively in the ipsilateral auditory brain stem. These include the lateral superior olive ({LSO}), ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, medial superior olive, dorsomedial and ventromedial periolivary nuclei, and the {MNTB} itself. At the {EM} level the myelinated collaterals gave rise to terminals that contained nonround vesicles and, in the {LSO}, were seen terminating on cell bodies and primary dendrites. Responses of {MNTB} cells were similar to their primary excitatory input, the globular bushy cell ({GBC}), in a number of ways. The spontaneous spike rate of {MNTB} cells with low characteristic frequencies ({CFs}) was low, whereas it tended to be higher for higher {CF} units. In response to short tones, a low frequency {MNTB} cell showed enhanced phase-locking abilities, relative to auditory nerve fibers. For cells with {CFs} {\textgreater}1 {kHz}, the short tone response often resembled the primary-like with notch response seen in many globular bushy cells, with a well-timed onset component. Exceptions to and variations of this standard response were also noted. When compared with {GBCs} with comparable {CFs}, the latency of the {MNTB} cell response was delayed slightly, as would be expected given the synapse interposed between the two cell types. Our data thus confirm that, in the cat, the {MNTB} receives and converts synaptic inputs from globular bushy cells into a reasonably accurate reproduction of the bushy cell spike response. This {MNTB} cell output then becomes an important inhibitory input to a number of ipsilateral auditory brain stem nuclei.},

For low frequency sounds, i.e., in the range 270 Hz-1.5 {KHz}, the mammalian auditory pathway achieves this by extracting the Interaural Time Difference between sound signals being received by the left and right ear. This processing is performed in a region of the brain known as the Medial Superior Olive ({MSO}). This paper presents a Spiking Neural Network ({SNN}) based model of the {MSO}. The network model is trained using the Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity learning rule using experimentally observed Head Related Transfer Function data in an adult domestic cat. The results presented demonstrate how the proposed {SNN} model is able to perform sound localization with an accuracy of 91.82\% when an error tolerance of +/-10 degrees is used. For angular resolutions down to 2.5 degrees , it will be demonstrated how software based simulations of the model incur significant computation times. The paper thus also addresses preliminary implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array based hardware platform to accelerate system performance.},

It includes physical measurements of interaural time differences and intensity differences, and attempts to relate these differences to the localization response at a variety of frequencies. The stimuli to be localized were provided through earphones, and the subject was required to match the position (in his head) of a noise and a tone. The noise to one ear was delayed, and the tone presented with no time or phase difference. The subject adjusted the interaural level of the tone until it and the noise appeared to be in the same place. The two were presented alternately by means of a gate having a 150‐msec rise and decay time.Data from the localization judgments were then compared with the findings from the acoustical measurements of time and intensity.

	abstract = {Spike timing is precise in the auditory system and it has been argued that it conveys information about auditory stimuli, in particular about the location of a sound source. However, beyond simple time differences, the way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and the potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational difficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an unexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on the unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of spectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the binaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony patterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal. Location-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation of location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a spiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety of sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human head-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately estimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and elevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic environment. We found that multiple representations of different acoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural assemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian learning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative spike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently of the source signal.},

	abstract = {The dominant cue for localization of low-frequency sounds are microsecond differences in the time-of-arrival of sounds at the two ears [interaural time difference ({ITD})]. In mammals, {ITD} sensitivity is established in the medial superior olive ({MSO}) by coincidence detection of excitatory inputs from both ears. Hence the relative delay of the binaural inputs is crucial for adjusting {ITD} sensitivity in {MSO} cells. How these delays are constructed is, however, still unknown. Specifically, the question of whether inhibitory inputs are involved in timing the net excitation in {MSO} cells, and if so how, is controversial. These inhibitory inputs derive from the nuclei of the trapezoid body, which have physiological and structural specializations for high-fidelity temporal transmission, raising the possibility that well timed inhibition is involved in tuning {ITD} sensitivity. Here, we present physiological and pharmacological data from in vivo extracellular {MSO} recordings in anesthetized gerbils. Reversible blockade of synaptic inhibition by iontophoretic application of the glycine antagonist strychnine increased firing rates and significantly shifted {ITD} sensitivity of {MSO} neurons. This indicates that glycinergic inhibition plays a major role in tuning the delays of binaural excitation. We also tonically applied glycine, which lowered firing rates but also shifted {ITD} sensitivity in a way analogous to strychnine. Hence tonic glycine application experimentally decoupled the effect of inhibition from the timing of its inputs. We conclude that, for proper {ITD} processing, not only is inhibition necessary, but it must also be precisely timed.},

	abstract = {The traditional view that a tympanic middle ear developed only once, when vertebrates made the transition from fish in water to land-living animals, has been shown to be incorrect. Middle ears with a tympanum connected by one or more ossicles to the cochlea developed very much later in evolutionary history and independently in many amniote vertebrate lineages – most now extinct. The mammalian middle ear is unique but it is not simply an “improved” single-ossicle middle ear. It is a radical and fortuitous new development that owes its origin more to changes in feeding patterns than to hearing. It happened to transmit higher-frequency sounds better than single-ossicle middle ears and enabled the evolution of the high upper-frequency hearing limits of most mammals. Parallel to the development of a tympanic middle ear in therian mammals, the brain increased in size and a secondary palate developed, resulting in the ancestral pressure-gradient middle ear being replaced by a purely pressure system. Sound localization then became almost completely dependent on neural computation and this was the most important factor driving up the upper frequency limits of early mammals. This paper presents an historical perspective on these remarkably simple and yet highly effective structures.},

Here we present evidence derived from in vitro and in vivo experiments in gerbils indicating that the coincidence-detector neurons in the medial superior olive modulate their sensitivity to interaural time differences through a rapid, {GABA}(B) receptor-mediated feedback mechanism. We show that this mechanism provides a gain control in the form of output normalization, which influences the neuronal population code of auditory space. Furthermore, psychophysical tests showed that the paradigm used to evoke neuronal {GABA}(B) receptor-mediated adaptation causes the perceptual shift in sound localization in humans that was expected on the basis of our physiological results in gerbils.},

While much is known about how hearing works, little of this knowledge has been applied in the speech analysis field. We propose models of the inner ear, or cochlea, which are expressed as time- and place-domain signal processing operations; i.e. the models are computational expressions of the important functions of the cochlea. The main parts of the models concern mechanical filtering effects and the mapping of mechanical vibrations into neural representation. Our model cleanly separates these effects into time-invariant linear filtering based on a simple cascade/parallel filterbank network of second-order sections, plus transduction and compression based on half-wave rectification with a nonlinear coupled automatic gain control network. Compared to other speech analysis techniques, this model does a much better job of preserving important detail in both time and frequency, which is important for robust sound analysis. We discuss the ways in which this model differs from more detailed cochlear models.},

	abstract = {Microsecond differences in the arrival time of a sound at the two ears (interaural time differences, {ITDs}) are the main cue for localizing low-frequency sounds in space. Traditionally, {ITDs} are thought to be encoded by an array of coincidence-detector neurons, receiving excitatory inputs from the two ears via axons of variable length (‘delay lines’), to create a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space1,2. Compelling evidence for the existence of such a map in the mammalian {lTD} detector, the medial superior olive ({MSO}), however, is lacking. Equally puzzling is the role of a—temporally very precise3—glycine-mediated inhibitory input to {MSO} neurons. Using in vivo recordings from the {MSO} of the Mongolian gerbil, we found the responses of {ITD}-sensitive neurons to be inconsistent with the idea of a topographic map of auditory space. Moreover, local application of glycine and its antagonist strychnine by iontophoresis (through glass pipette electrodes, by means of an electric current) revealed that precisely timed glycine-controlled inhibition is a critical part of the mechanism by which the physiologically relevant range of {ITDs} is encoded in the {MSO}. A computer model, simulating the response of a coincidence-detector neuron with bilateral excitatory inputs and a temporally precise contralateral inhibitory input, supports this conclusion.},

	abstract = {In mammals, principal neurons of the medial superior olive ({MSO}) exhibit biophysical specializations that enable them to detect sound localization cues with microsecond precision. In the present study, we used whole-cell patch recordings to examine the development of the intrinsic electrical properties of these neurons in brainstem slices from postnatal day 14 (P14) to P38 gerbils. In the week after hearing onset (P14–P21), we observed dramatic reductions in somatic {EPSP} duration, input resistance, and membrane time constant. Surprisingly, somatically recorded action potentials also dramatically declined in amplitude over a similar period (38 ± 3 to 17 ± 2 {mV}; τ = 5.2 d). Simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch recordings revealed that these action potentials were initiated in the axon, which primarily emerged from the soma. In older gerbils, the rapid speed of membrane voltage changes and the attenuation of action potential amplitudes were mediated extensively by low voltage-activated potassium channels containing the Kv1.1 subunit. In addition, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings revealed that these potassium channels increase nearly fourfold from P14 to P23 and are thus a major component of developmental changes in excitability. Finally, the electrophysiological features of principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body did not change after P14, indicating that posthearing regulation of intrinsic membrane properties is not a general feature of all time-coding auditory neurons. We suggest that the striking electrical segregation of the axon from the soma and dendrites of {MSO} principal neurons minimizes spike-induced distortion of synaptic potentials and thus preserves the accuracy of binaural comparisons.},

	abstract = {The dominant cue for localization of low-frequency sounds are microsecond differences in the time-of-arrival of sounds at the two ears [interaural time difference ({ITD})]. In mammals, {ITD} sensitivity is established in the medial superior olive ({MSO}) by coincidence detection of excitatory inputs from both ears. Hence the relative delay of the binaural inputs is crucial for adjusting {ITD} sensitivity in {MSO} cells. How these delays are constructed is, however, still unknown. Specifically, the question of whether inhibitory inputs are involved in timing the net excitation in {MSO} cells, and if so how, is controversial. These inhibitory inputs derive from the nuclei of the trapezoid body, which have physiological and structural specializations for high-fidelity temporal transmission, raising the possibility that well timed inhibition is involved in tuning {ITD} sensitivity. Here, we present physiological and pharmacological data from in vivo extracellular {MSO} recordings in anesthetized gerbils. Reversible blockade of synaptic inhibition by iontophoretic application of the glycine antagonist strychnine increased firing rates and significantly shifted {ITD} sensitivity of {MSO} neurons. This indicates that glycinergic inhibition plays a major role in tuning the delays of binaural excitation. We also tonically applied glycine, which lowered firing rates but also shifted {ITD} sensitivity in a way analogous to strychnine. Hence tonic glycine application experimentally decoupled the effect of inhibition from the timing of its inputs. We conclude that, for proper {ITD} processing, not only is inhibition necessary, but it must also be precisely timed.},

	abstract = {Feedforward inhibition sharpens the precision of neurons throughout ascending auditory pathways, including the binaural neurons of the medial superior olive ({MSO}). However, the biophysical influence of inhibition is poorly understood, particularly at higher frequencies where the relative phase of inhibition and excitation becomes ambiguous. Here, we show in gerbil {MSO} principal cells in vitro that feedforward inhibition precedes direct excitation, providing a concurrent hyperpolarization and conductance shunt during {EPSP} summation. We show with dual patch recordings and dynamic clamp that both the linearity and temporal fidelity of synaptic integration is improved by reducing Kv1 potassium channel conductance during inhibition, which counters membrane shunting even at high frequencies where {IPSPs} sum. The reduction of peak excitation by preceding inhibition lowers spike probability, narrowing but not shifting the window for detecting binaural coincidence. The interplay between inhibition and potassium conductances thus improves the consistency and resolution of {ITD} coding across different frequencies.},
